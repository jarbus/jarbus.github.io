If you see something you think you might like, what is wrong with trying it out? If there is a show that piques your interest or a game you think you might enjoy, what is the harm of sampling it? </p> <p> Well, because you might actually enjoy it. </p> <p> There are more than 7 billion people alive, 3 billion of whom have access to the internet, and there are easily tens of millions of people who post engaging content every day. I'd argue that there are more books I'd absolutely love to read than would be feasible for me to read in my entire lifetime. Likewise, these days there is simply an over-abundance of quality content. There are too many shows, too many bloggers and too many news channels to reasonably consume all the content you'd like to consume. At most, you could be constantly consuming content 20 hours a day every day, and you still wouldn't be engaging with everything you'd like. </p> <p> True understanding and appreciation comes not from consuming, but digesting. You could sit in university lecture 20 hours a day and never learn a thing, because you don't have time to think about anything after the lecture is over. Likewise, if all you do is start another story right after the current one ends, you don't give yourself time to sit on it and think it over. You don't gain an appreciation of the characters without thinking about why they might have decided to do what they did the following day. If you binge a Crash Course playlist about a topic of interest, you essentially forget everything you've learned from the previous video. Without taking time to digest your food, you don't gain any mental sustenance from it.</p> <p> So why should you not consume something if you think you might like it? If something might gain you even a small amount of pleasure, and you've already had enough time to digest whatever content you consumed previously, what's the problem?</p> <p> In reality, there is no problem. That is to say, there is a lack of problem in the same way using a gas-guzzling car isn't a problem. It gets the job done, and individually it's not a big deal, but its a massive inefficiency. There is an awesome amount of high-quality, easily consumable and easily findable content online that it's a waste of one's time to watch something that's "pretty good". Raise your expectations. Demand better. Your time is worth more than you think, even if you have lots of it.</p> <p> Finding a high-quality curator on the internet is essential if one wishes to use their time to the fullest. Many algorithms can provide decent recommendations, and if you find a goldmine of quality content said algorithms will certainly help you clear out the mine. However, they don't know the difference between "good" and "great", just "hotter" and "colder". As of right now, humans are still much better at determining quality than a bot, which only has "likes" and "engagement time" to determine quality, attributes which can be easily manipulated without improving the material. A solid curator will find content that is not only high quality, but relevant with other content in said curator's collection, allowing you to ocassionally gain a greater of an appreciation from the collection as a whole.</p> <p> Reminder that everything stated above is merely the opinion of another person, and should be taken with a grain of salt. The goal of all my posts is to prompt thought and give readers something to think about. There are obviously strong arguments against everything I just wrote about, and this is simply an extreme&mdash; the true answer lies somewhere in the middle. </p> </main></html>
