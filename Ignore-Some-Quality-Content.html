What’s wrong with sampling something that piques your interest?</p> <p>Well, because you might enjoy it.</p> <p>There’s over 7 billion people alive, 3 billion of whom with Internet access, and tens of millions of people posting engaging content every day. With more books in existence than I could sort through in a lifetime, there’s an overabundance of quality content, specifically online. There are too many shows, bloggers, and news channels it’s not possible to consume everything one would like.  Even consuming content 20 hours a day every day still wouldn’t allow you to engage with everything you‘d enjoy.</p> <p>True understanding and appreciation comes not from consumption but digestion. You could sit in university lecture 20 hours a day, every day, and end up never take away a thing beacuse you don‘t go back over what you learned. Without taking time to digest your food, you gain no mental sustenance from it.</p> <p>How does this relate to ignoring interesting content? If you might gain even a small bit of pleasure and have taken enough time to digest whatever content you consumed, what’s the problem?</p> <p>In reality, there’s no problem, in the same way using a gas-guzzling car isn’t a problem. It gets the job done, but incredibly inefficiently. There is an awesome quantity of high-quality, consumable, and findable content online, it’s a waste of one’s time to watch something that’s “pretty good.” Raise your expectations. Demand better. Your time is valuable. Don’t waste it if you’ll forget what you used it for.</p> <p>Finding a high-quality curator on the Internet is essential if one wishes to use their time to the fullest. Algorithms can offer decent recommendations, and if you find a goldmine of quality content, said algorithms will help you clear out the mine. However, they can’t differentiate between “good” and “great”, just “hotter” and “colder”. A solid curator will find high-quality content that is additionally relevant with other content in said curator’s collection. With each section of the collection fitting into a comprehensive theme, you paint a much bigger picture across multiple works. Take, for example, George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Both novels are fantastic by themselves, but new ideas about human nature spring when they’re intentionally compared side-by-side, and not when Amazon.com says, “Customers who liked 1984 also liked…”</p> <p>A key takeaway is to not settle for good when you can find something great — if you finish something that was “alright”, you wasted your time. To find great content, find someone with similar tastes as you and go through their collection, comparing and contrasting individual parts to create a greater whole.</p> <p>Please take a reminder that everything stated above is merely my opinion and nothing more. All of my posts are intended to prompt thought within the reader. There are obviously strong arguments against everything I wrote about, and this is an extreme — the true answer lies somewhere in the middle. A strong counterargument to relying on curation is that you find little content that isn’t well known. There are lots of creators with an audience size of less than 100 who might make incredible stuff you’d never find.</p> </main></html>
