    <p>How great would it be if the solution to most errors you face were in the first place you looked? That&rsquo;s what the Arch-Wiki has been for me: a massive wealth of information and troubleshooting resources to help me navigate configuration and installation issues I encounter day-to-day. Some people claim Arch Linux is too difficult for new users, but for me it&rsquo;s been the only distribution I&rsquo;ve been able to get working, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to the detailed documentation.</p>
<p>I run a Dell XPS 9560, and have tried and failed to install Ubuntu and Manjaro on multiple occassions. Sometimes, the automatic installers would fail, other times they would succeed but install a broken configuration, leaving me with networking configurations that would crash as much as it would connect. However, when installing Arch, I resolved each installation error with the help of the wiki, so that by the time I was in a graphical desktop environment, everything was running smoothly.</p>
<p>I love exciting, and popular software, but installing Arch showed me that <em>popular</em> isn&rsquo;t as important as <em>understandable</em>. Software will always break; I don&rsquo;t think there isn&rsquo;t a single program I use daily whose configuration I haven&rsquo;t broken at some point. But when I encounter an installation error, or a feature isn&rsquo;t working, or I need to use a program for an unintended purpose, choosing programs with extensive documentation and active community resources has always saved me a headache.</p>
