That&rsquo;s what the <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/>Arch Wiki</a> has been for me: a massive wealth of information and troubleshooting resources to help me navigate the various configuration and installation issues I&rsquo;ve encountered.

Sometimes, the automatic installers would fail, other times they would succeed but install a broken configuration, leaving me with networking configurations that would crash as much as it would connect<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. However, when installing Arch, I resolved each installation error with the help of the wiki, so that by the time I was in a graphical desktop environment, everything was running smoothly.</p><p>When I got my next laptop, I looked on the arch wiki to make sure there would be as few issues as possible setting up Linux&mdash;and I faced none when installing.</p><p>I love exciting, and popular, and <em>new</em> software, but installing Arch showed me that <em>popular</em> isn&rsquo;t as important as <em>understandable</em>. Software will always break; I don&rsquo;t think there isn&rsquo;t a single program I use daily whose configuration I haven&rsquo;t broken at some point. But when I encounter an installation error, or a feature isn&rsquo;t working, or I need to use a program for an unintended purpose, choosing programs with extensive documentation and active community resources has always saved me a headache.</p><p>I use Hugo to generate this website. It&rsquo;s so well documented (and there are bountiful answers on StackOverflow) that not only can I usually find the answer to the thing I want to do in the first few search results, but GPT-4 can often make a specific change I want too.</p><p>With all else equal, take the road most documented.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This was before 2020, I&rsquo;m sure these issues are largely fixed by now&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2024-01-28</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=../../blog/take-the-road-most-documented/>/blog/take-the-road-most-documented/</a>
