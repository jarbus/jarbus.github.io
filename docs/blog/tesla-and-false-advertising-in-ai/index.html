When I got my Apple Watch, I hoped to use it to respond to messages without getting distracted by my phone. I quickly realized that wasn&rsquo;t a viable solution: I had to repeat my message multiple times per text in order to get the correct dictation.</p><p>If this was a software issue, I could file a bug report and Apple could send out a fix. Unfortunately with AI, there isn&rsquo;t much Apple can do besides get more data and re-train the model, which still wouldn&rsquo;t guarantee a better user experience for anyone. Mind you, this is with software that&rsquo;s already shipped.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s look at Tesla, or more specifically its CEO, Elon Musk. <a href=https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy>Musk claims that Level 5 driving (in which a human is not needed behind the wheel) will be coming to Tesla vehicles in the form of a software update by the end of 2020</a>. A month before he made said claim, <a href=https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-autopilot-slam-overturned-truck>a Tesla on autopilot crashed into a flipped truck</a>&ndash;a mistake most humans wouldn&rsquo;t make.</p><p>Just like Apple can&rsquo;t promise its speech-to-text system will work better than a human (or even better than a toddler), Musk can&rsquo;t guarantee anything about Tesla&rsquo;s Level 5 capability. Tesla can&rsquo;t even &ldquo;reasonably claim&rdquo; your car won&rsquo;t crash into flipped trucks or <a href=https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/another-tesla-crashes-into-a-cop-car-while-on-autopilot/ar-BB16Mvkk#!>stopped cop cars</a>. In fact, no one using deep learning can promise anything about their system. Deep learning, and by extension Tesla&rsquo;s Autopilot system, is a black box. We don&rsquo;t know why it works, we can&rsquo;t promise that it&rsquo;ll work, but it seems to work when we test it. Unless Tesla is testing on all roads in all conditions, they shouldn&rsquo;t even be &ldquo;confident&rdquo; level 5 technology, in which <strong>a human does not need to be in the vehicle</strong>, is &ldquo;around the corner&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s why <a href=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autopilot-germany/german-court-bans-tesla-ad-statements-related-to-autonomous-driving-idUSKCN24F1T5>a court in Germany banned Tesla from including “full potential for autonomous driving” and “Autopilot inclusive” in its German advertising materials</a>.</p><p>A Full Self-Driving (FSD) update wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time Tesla over-promises and under-delivers. Consumer Reports described the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smart Summon&rdquo; feature as <a href=https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/>&ldquo;glitchy and at times worked intermittently&rdquo;</a>. The damage with Smart Summon has been low, but a full-autonomy update could result in a few consequences:</p><ul><li>Tesla sold cars with the promise of Level 5 driving in the future: Not only is Tesla now under immense pressure to rush out a Level 5 update as soon as possible, but must do so using the hardware it sold customers years ago. Hopefully Level 5 doesn&rsquo;t require LIDAR sensors (or any additional hardware) like Elon claims; because Tesla is expected to ship some version of FSD to users.</li><li>Customers may end up in legal trouble if Tesla&rsquo;s software fails them: Tesla avoids legal responsibility for buggy software by shifting responsibility of an accident to the driver. However, when Tesla sells millions of cars on the premise that users won&rsquo;t have to manually drive them one day, should drivers be held responsible when that day comes and their car crashes?</li></ul><p>Other companies have realized the high standards a Level 5 system should meet. Two years ago, <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades>Waymo CEO John Krafcik claimed that true self-driving cars, that function everywhere under all circumstances, won&rsquo;t be ubiquitous for decades</a>. As a result, Waymo shifted gears and placed its focus on rolling out <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona>autonomous taxis</a> on a city by city basis, starting in Pheonix, Arizona. This approach to Level 5 driving is much safer for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Waymo is minimizing the number of people at risk</li><li>Waymo is operating its vehicles strictly where they have been tested.</li><li>Waymo is not selling consumers a technology that doesn&rsquo;t exist</li><li>Waymo is not relying on the average consumer to be attentive</li></ul><p>Level 5 technology can save thousands of lives and millions of dollars&ndash;but it needs to be done to the same (if not higher) standards of automotive testing, and not the &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo; approach of Silicon Valley. Hopefully Tesla can safely deliver on its promise of full self driving soon, but if not, consumers may soon have a case to demand a refund.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2020-07-22</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=../../blog/tesla-and-false-advertising-in-ai/>/blog/tesla-and-false-advertising-in-ai/</a>
