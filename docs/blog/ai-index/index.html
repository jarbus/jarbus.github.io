They can do this in an unsupervised fashion, since their output targets are the given input, requiring no labeling.</li>

In this problem, expected gain must be maximized in an environment with varying rewards, forcing an agent to decide between keeping an option they know to be safe versus exploring new options that might be better.</li>
