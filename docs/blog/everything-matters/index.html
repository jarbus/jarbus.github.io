I could write a book on how strongly I subscribed to this area of thought, but that&rsquo;s not the point of this post; you&rsquo;ll have to trust that the following comes from someone who climbed out of the pit:</p><p><em>Everything matters.</em> And that&rsquo;s even scarier.</p><p>I still don&rsquo;t believe in broad concepts like &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; or &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo;. I believe in biological reactions that make something feel meaningful or fulfilling. Those reactions are what matters, and I think nihilism&rsquo;s pull is strongest on those who lack them. But we can hack our minds.</p><p>We want to feel our lives our meaningful, that they are worth living. If your life lacks meaning, there is a good chance you believe one of the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Life inherently has no meaning, and nothing will change that.</strong></li><li><strong>Life will only have meaning once you have a family, dream job, etc.</strong></li></ol><p>There&rsquo;s a secret third belief on the table, though&mdash;secret in the sense that everyone knows it, but nearly nobody believes it:</p><ol start=3><li><strong>Life has as much meaning as you give it.</strong></li></ol><p>Each compliment you give to a stranger can make their day. A stranger complimented a jacket I had in September 2024, and I still remember it, because no stranger ever complimented my clothes before.</p><p>What&rsquo;s crazy is that anyone can do this at any time, most just choose not to. It&rsquo;s free, and usually has positive effects.</p><p>A few more things that have a huge (but often invisible) return on investment:</p><ul><li>Remembering someone&rsquo;s birthday (+1 for getting them a gift)</li><li>Telling someone you&rsquo;re enjoying a gift they got you</li><li>Remembering small details that someone told you (the project they were working on, their best friend&rsquo;s name, etc)</li><li>Getting someone flowers (for a partner, milestone, etc)</li><li>Complimenting strangers (without being creepy)</li><li>Smiling at people</li><li>Inviting people to grab dinner</li><li>Asking genuine questions when listening to someone talk about their passion</li><li>Checking if someone is OK</li></ul><p>People live life believing their actions mostly don&rsquo;t matter. They unnecessarily ghost, show up late, forget important details, back out of commitments, or fail to show up when they&rsquo;re needed. Everyone acts unbothered, but we notice, and it hurts. Why wouldn&rsquo;t the opposite be true?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know why I started trying to put effort into the little things&mdash;probably to further convince myself nothing matters and thus justify my position. But that&rsquo;s not how our mind works. We feel meaning when we make others happy, especially others who feel forgotten, because in that moment, we matter to them. At least a little bit.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2025-06-19</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=../../blog/everything-matters/>/blog/everything-matters/</a>
