Here, too, the animal showed man the way. The web of the spider, the nest of the bird, the crossing and texture of fibres and leaves in the natural embroidery of the woods, set an example so obvious that in all probability weaving was one of the earliest arts of the human race&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cattle were a convenient standard of value and medium of exchange among hunters and herders; they bore interest through breeding, and they were easy to carry, since they transported themselves&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=communism>Communism

For the Chinese do not flaunt their pictures on public or private walls; they roll them up and store them carefully away and unfold them for occasional enjoyment as we take down and read a book&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hui Tsung, with an empire at his command, gave half his life to painting birds and flowers.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;the world of beauty and the world of money never touch, even when beautiful things are sold.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The educated classes displayed long nails as Western women wore French heels—to indicate their exemption from physical toil&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the third century Hua To wrote a volume on surgery and made operations popular by inventing a wine which produced a general anesthesia; it is one of the stupidities of history that the formula for mixing this drink has been lost&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Soap was a rare luxury, but lice and vermin were easily secured&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;For through this profound institution the nation, which was shut out from physical and spatial unity by great distances and the poverty of transport, achieved a powerful spiritual unity in time; the generations were bound together with the tough web of tradition, and the individual life received an ennobling share and significance in a drama of timeless majesty and scope.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;But in the second century of our era these doctrines were improved upon by men who claimed to have received, in direct line from Lao-tze, an elixir that would confer immortality. This drink became so popular that several emperors are said to have died from pious indulgence in it&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;What the Chinese,&rdquo; said Voltaire, &ldquo;best know, cultivate the most, and have brought to the greatest perfection, is morality.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;By building the house on a sound foundation,&rdquo; Confucius had said, &ldquo;the world is made secure&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though economically subordinate the woman enjoyed the franchise of the tongue, and might scold her man into fright or flight in the best Occidental style&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The most impressive aspect of this civilization was its system of government. If the ideal state is a combination of democracy and aristocracy, the Chinese have had it for more than a thousand years; if the best government is that which governs least, then the Chinese have had the best. Never has a government governed so many people, or governed them so little, or so long.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was not a word in any of the tests about science, business or industry; the object was to reveal not knowledge but judgment and character. Those who survived the tests were at last eligible for the higher offices in the state&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Considerable portions of this indemnity were later remitted to China by the United States, Great Britain, Russia and Japan, usually with the stipulation that the remitted sums bespent in educating students from China in the universities of the remitting nation. It was a gesture of generosity, which proved more effective in the undoing of old China than almost any other single factor in this historic and tragic conflict of East and West.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The European world, which had proposed a moratorium on robbery after it had gathered in all available spoils joined America feebly in protests against this candid plunder, but prepared, as always, to accept victory as justification in the end.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once everything changed except the East; now there is nothing in the East that does not change. The most conservative nation in history has suddenly become, after Russia, the most radical, and is destroying with a will customs and institutions once held inviolate. It is not merely the end of a dynasty, as in 1644; it is the moulting of a civilization&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The queue is gone, and so are the graceful manners of the older time; the hatreds of revolution have coarsened the spirit, and radicals find it hard to be courteous to conservatives&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Revolution, like death and style, is the removal of rubbish, the surgery of the superfluous; it comes only when there are many things ready to die. China has died many times before; and many times she has been reborn.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=japan>Japan

They watch for the blossoms appropriate to each season; and when, for a week or two in early April, the cherry-tree blooms, all Japan seems to leave its work to gaze at it, or even to make pilgrimages to places where the miracle is most abundant and complete&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Criminals en route to execution will sometimes ask for a flower&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The more serious devotee might cleanse his spirit by praying for a quarter of an hour under a waterfall in the depth of winter; or he might go on pilgrimages from shrine to shrine of his sect, meanwhile feasting his soul on the beauty of his native land&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The aim of learning is not merely to widen knowledge but to form character. Its object is to make us true men, rather than learned men.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The chief reason why the teachings of the sages are not more appreciated by the people is because scholars endeavor to show off their learning, rather than to make it their endeavor to live up to the teachings of the sages.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Shogunate trembled at the notion that every man might judge for himself what was right and what was wrong.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;When he died they placed this enviable epitaph upon his tomb: He did not talk about the faults of others&mldr;He cared for nothing but books. His life was uneventful&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unlike Togai he enjoyed controversy and spoke his mind violently about philosophers living or dead. When an inquiring young man asked him, &ldquo;What do you like besides reading?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;There is nothing better than eating burnt beans and criticizing the great men of Japan.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Jesuits, harassed with these linguistic barriers, reported that the language of the islands had been invented by the Devil to prevent the preaching of the Gospel to the Japanese.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Japanese, with whom gambling is a favorite passion, wagered so much money in haiku-composing contests that some enterprising souls made a business of conducting them, fleecing thousands of devotees daily, until at last the government was forced to raid these poetical resorts and prohibit this new mercenary art&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Murasaki writes with a naturalness and ease that soon turn her pages into the charming gossip of a cultured friend.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;He accepted poverty with good humor and, having no furniture, hung his bare walls with paintings of the furniture he might have had.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;On his deathbed Ikku enjoined his pupils to place upon his corpse, before the cremation then usual in Japan, certain packets which he solemnly entrusted to them.

Ikku had kept his youthful promise that his life would be full of surprises, even after his death&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The death of a civilization seldom comes from without; internal decay must weaken the fibre of a society before external influences or attacks can change its essential structure, or bring it to an end.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The eternal war of the generations—the revolt of over-eager youth against overcautious age—has been intensified by the growth of individualist industry, and the weakening of religious faith&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Chinese boycott of Japanese goods ensued; but Japan proceeded on the historically correct assumption that boycotts are sooner or later frustrated by the tendency of trade to follow the line of lowest costs&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion
