We typically judge Big Tech by what they do, or what they have done. However, the fundamental principles and incentives driving these companies are revealed when we extrapolate their behavior into a hypothetical future where they can grow with no restraints.

Just iOS devices. Everyone replaces AirPods every year and a half once their batteries wear out. No software exists that is not approved by Apple. Consumers keep filling up their device storage with &ldquo;Other&rdquo; and &ldquo;System&rdquo; storage that they cannot locate, so they get new devices often, opting for the smallest amount of storage space each time, to repeat the cycle. People generally forget how computers and files work, and rely on apple-designed share menus for all actions between apps. iPads replace all laptops. Everyone uses Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Fitness+, Apple Arcade, Apple TV, Siri, etc. Apple Pay is universal, and Apple taxes 30% of every purchase.</p><p>Apple&rsquo;s endgame is that of absolute authority.</p><h2 id=meta>Meta

They feed your purchase history, traumas, addictions, and political views into an algorithm that generates advertisements specifically optimized to be most effective on <em>you</em>. Everyone is dangerously addicted to social media. All online communities are on either Facebook or Instagram. If you aren&rsquo;t on their Metaverse, you aren&rsquo;t part of society. Not that society is worth it anymore; it&rsquo;s a sea of mentally ill consumers, exposed to media that alternates between reasons to feel inadequate and advertisements for products that will make them happy. Meta nonetheless avoids pushing users too close to suicide, as user loss may drive down their stock price.</p><p>Meta&rsquo;s endgame is that of surveillance, addiction, manipulation, and mental illness.</p><h2 id=amazon>Amazon

Every product is an Amazon Basics product. Every specialist is found through Amazon. Groceries, pharmacies, technology, clothes, entertainment, printing, mail, every small and large business replaced by one company that has everything from A to Z. The entire world either relies on or employed by Amazon. The entire internet runs on AWS servers. Consumers happily pay thousands of dollars for the convenience of their Amazon prime membership. Alexa is always within earshot, so employees can order new bottles to pee in anywhere in the world with same day delivery.</p><p>Amazon&rsquo;s endgame is that of world conquest.</p><h2 id=google>Google

Likes and comments have been removed as they are a form of hate speech, and in their place, Liberty Mutual ads. The first and second pages of Google Search are sponsored content, but nobody switches to a different engine. Every website is at least 20Mb of advertising and analytics. Google is the only provider for email, maps, calendar, contacts, translation, cloud storage, collaboration, game streaming. And for some reason, everyone uses Google+.</p><p>Google&rsquo;s endgame is that of centralization.</p><h2 id=microsoft>Microsoft

Once Microsoft realized themselves incapable of making a functional product, the company doubled down on buying companies that were. MacOS is dead, Linux is but a subsystem for Windows, and both Android and iOS have since been replaced by Windows Mobile once app developers started releasing ARM builds.</p><p>Microsoft&rsquo;s endgame is that of purchase, then extend.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2022-02-09</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=//localhost:1313/blog/corporate-endgames/>//localhost:1313/blog/corporate-endgames/</a>
