NON-TECHNICAL

    
        
    



Students often lack crucial skills. Technical students may lack communication skills, or social butterflies may lack depth. Some lack both. This doesn&rsquo;t really matter, in my opinion, if they are willing to learn. Just like neural networks, they may be all over the place initially, but students who reflect on your feedback will (eventually) be worth more than those who never update their parameters. Don&rsquo;t give up on those who listen and try; they often just need the right kind of mentorship."><link rel=icon type=image/png href=../../favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed href=../../favicon.png><style>body{visibility:hidden;opacity:0}</style><noscript><style>body{visibility:visible;opacity:1}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=../../css/style.min.df7ab593181f6eb095bf3467d78b611aae723a1a52787089b45a198b6e0f43cf.css integrity="sha256-33q1kxgfbrCVvzRn14thGq5yOhpSeHCJtFoZi24PQ88="><script src=../../js/script.min.74bf1a3fcf1af396efa4acf3e660e876b61a2153ab9cbe1893ac24ea6d4f94ee.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-dL8aP88a85bvpKzz5mDodrYaIVOrnL4Yk6wk6m1PlO4="></script><script src=../../js/script.min.cef56383505bdd943196b6090ac7df0a357e5f68da0e6b85a559fc035e9df26a.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-zvVjg1Bb3ZQxlrYJCsffCjV+X2jaDmuFpVn8A16d8mo="></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}},window.addEventListener("load",e=>{document.querySelectorAll("mjx-container").forEach(function(e){e.parentElement.classList+="has-jax"})})</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></head><body><a class=skip-main href=#main>Skip to main content</a><div class=container><header class=common-header><div class=header-top><h1 class=site-title><a href=../../></a></h1></div><img src=../../dithered-tree-contrast.gif alt="Dithered Tree" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-height:20vh"><nav><a href=../../ title=home>~jarbus</a>

Technical students may lack communication skills, or social butterflies may lack depth. Some lack both. This doesn&rsquo;t really matter, in my opinion, if they are <strong>willing to learn</strong>. Just like neural networks, they may be all over the place initially, but students who reflect on your feedback will (eventually) be worth more than those who never update their parameters. Don&rsquo;t give up on those who listen and try; they often just need the right kind of mentorship.</p></li><li><p>Some students might be eager to learn, but have a <strong>poor approach to learning</strong>. It&rsquo;s often easy to correct; if you ask how they approach a problem and why they&rsquo;re approaching it that way, you&rsquo;ll unearth the faults in their process. Most of the time, you don&rsquo;t need to correct them&mdash;you can often describe how you&rsquo;d approach their problem, and, perhaps after a few more failed attempts, they&rsquo;ll try it your way, all on their own. This worked on me, anyway.</p></li><li><p>The packaging of a message matters more than its content. <strong>I can pretty much tell anyone anything if I phrase it with thought, respect, and tact</strong>. This takes time, effort, and lots of practice. If someone gets defensive and reacts negatively to your feedback, you likely could have phrased it better.</p></li><li><p>Effective communication is as important for your career as a top-tier publication&mdash;perhaps moreso. If you can&rsquo;t describe why your work is significant, it probably doesn&rsquo;t matter what your results are. Conversely, if your results are less stellar than you hoped, you can still sell them to a reader with the right discussion and analysis.</p></li><li><p>To communicate well, you need to read and write&mdash;a lot. More than you think. Some resources that have helped me:</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eats,_Shoots_%26_Leaves>Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation</a> &mdash; Punctuation is like shell syntax for language. I didn&rsquo;t realize how fundamental punctuation is for writing until my cousin recommended me this.</li><li><a href=https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs114/reading-keshav.pdf>How to Read a Paper</a> &mdash; 2 page pdf that might save you days of your life.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book>How to Read a Book</a> &mdash; Don&rsquo;t read books from front-to-end, and spend a decent amount of time understanding the table of contents. Read a lot, read widely.</li><li><a href=https://paulgraham.com/simply.html>Write simply</a> &mdash; Clear writing takes a lot of effort, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</li></ul></li><li><p>Insight comes from many sources. Read widely, and <a href=https://jarbus.net/blog/read-weird-things/>read weird things</a>. I find computing history to be particularly illuminating, as it shows how technology changed over time.</p></li><li><p>Know your peers&mdash;this may be your last chance to become friends with a group of PhDs, most of whom will join different companies; this is an prime time to expand your network. Plus, the journey&rsquo;s more bearable with company.</p></li><li><p><strong>Care about your work</strong>. If you don&rsquo;t care about your project, nobody will. Learn about the area you work in; learn about the technology you&rsquo;re using; learn about why things are the way they are. Only two types of people have a chance at success anymore&mdash;those with passion, and those who crave status. I prefer those with passion.</p></li><li><p>If you don&rsquo;t care about your work, make yourself care&mdash;life is better this way.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/12/nietzsche-walking/>Take walks.</a></p></li><li><p>Learning yields an exponential return on investment. The bigger your knowledge graph, the easier it is to add edges and nodes. Reading papers in a field you know well can be effortless.</p></li><li><p>If you are still in the game, you haven&rsquo;t lost. Don&rsquo;t give into despair.</p></li><li><p><strong>Be reliable</strong>. Respond to messages and fulfill your commitments, without needing a reminder. It&rsquo;s nuts how many people can&rsquo;t manage this.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t burn bridges; people can change.</p></li><li><p>Be kind, but not soft.</p></li><li><p>Hold yourself and those around you to a realistic but high standard. A community aspiring to excellence can flourish; but those who see themselves part of a sinking ship are destined to drown.</p></li><li><p><strong>Each lab should have at least one student who is friendly with the rest of the department.</strong> Students often suffer in silence, and a well-connected social graph is critical for detecting and addressing serious problems.</p></li></ul><h1 id=technical>TECHNICAL
