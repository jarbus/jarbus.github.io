The cold metal scythe still in his lap, the skeleton hadn&rsquo;t moved an inch from where he left him earlier that morning.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s cooking, big guy?&rdquo; Jeff said as he walked to the kitchen to grab his last can of Budweiser. His boney companioned turned his head.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Oh, you know</em>&rdquo;, Death emitted. &ldquo;<em>still out of work.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I do not understand why you still haven&rsquo;t given up yet.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could say the same about you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I exist for one purpose, Jeffrey. and as long as you are alive, I cannot rest.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, you seem pretty well rested to me, what with you never leaving my house and all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I used to have what you call a &lsquo;job&rsquo;. It was very fulfilling, Jeffery. Took up all of my time. Do you want to know what it was?</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Jeffery took a sip of his beer.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>I used to collect the souls of the dead, Jeffery. It was wonderful. I conversed with the rich, the poor, the young and the old, Jeffrey, as they contemplated life and where they were headed. I had, what you would call, a &rsquo;nice thing going.&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All good things gotta come to an end.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Then you came along,</em>&rdquo; Death continued, ignoring him, &ldquo;<em>and ruined everything.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It be like that sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>It does not &lsquo;be&rsquo; like that sometimes, Jeffrey</em>&rdquo; Death glared, a purple glow forming in his eye sockets. &ldquo;<em>A single human does not wipe out humanity &rsquo;every now and then&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>What is even more despicable,</em>&rdquo; Death proceeded, &ldquo;<em>is that you don&rsquo;t even regret pushing the button.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really think about it too much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>YOU HAD A CHOICE,</em>&rdquo; Death boomed, &ldquo;<em>BETWEEN SAVING HUMANKIND, AND SAVING YOURSELF&ndash;</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mhm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>AND WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, DOOMED YOUR ENTIRE SPECIES&ndash;</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>&ndash;IN EXCHANGE FOR A LIFE OF THEFT AND SLUMBER.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t steal from the dead,&rdquo; Jeff rebutted, taking another sip.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>THAT IS NOT THE POINT, JEFFREY</em>&rdquo; Death bellowed. He paused, taking a few seconds to decompose himself. &ldquo;<em>You fail to understand the magnitude of your actions.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand perfectly well, you&rsquo;ve made sure of that. I&rsquo;d have to be deaf to spend a day with you and not hear your whining.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s hard to believe you even have a soul worth collecting.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, it was self defense, alright? It&rsquo;s not like I wanted to kill everyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Osama Bin Laden; every single corrupt soul in your history books would not have stooped to your level; self-defense does not justify genocide.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So humans can drive thousands of species to extinction for selfish gain, but only when it happens to them it&rsquo;s unjustified.&rdquo;</p><p>Death moved as if to rebutt, but said nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know how close we came to nuclear war? There was never a guarantee of tomorrow for anyone. For all we know, the human race might last an extra few decades thanks to me.&rdquo; Jeff said, smirking. &ldquo;Why does humanity deserves the benefit of the doubt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>Why do you?</em>&rdquo; Death said.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t necessarily,&rdquo; Jeff said, taking a seat on the opposite couch. &ldquo;It just happened to be my choice. My parents were already dead&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t owe anybody anything. What moral rule says I <em>have</em> to lay down my life for those I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>You are selfish, Jeffrey Johnson.</em>&rdquo; Death said, rising from his seat. &ldquo;<em>You put yourself in front of millions of good, innocent people who would lay down their lives in your situation.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it selfish, or simply not being selfless? A starving man doesn&rsquo;t owe another starving man his bread.&rdquo;</p><p>Death leaned forward, skull to face with Jeff, searching for any sign of remorse. He came back empty. Death turned around drifted towards the exit.</p><p>&ldquo;<em>He owes the guilt of denying a meal,</em>&rdquo; he remarked as he left the room. The front door creaked open, then closed. Silence filled the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Should I instead spend humanity&rsquo;s last years crying?&rdquo; Jeff yelled to the door.</p><p>The door didn&rsquo;t respond.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2020-04-27</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=../../blog/short-aftermath/>/blog/short-aftermath/</a>
