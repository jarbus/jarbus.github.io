Seven billion lifetimes of thought and contemplation. Of course, one cannot listen to every lifestory nor hear every person&rsquo;s opinion. So we form into groups, with each important group representing something between the loudest minority or general majority of people with a particular set of opinions. This is a system able to properly distinguish emerging schools of thought while categorizing people into said schools, enabling people to efficiently organize, communicate, and compare ideas.</p><p>This does not imply that everyone in a group has well formed opinions. Quite the opposite in fact &ndash; these groups require people to give considerably less thought into their beliefs. Immersing oneself in a group for a few ideas can easily lead to naturally picking up other beliefs of the group, as many people will adapt for acceptance. This lower barrier to entry for taking sides is a core part of the conflict between groups, as society seems to reinforce beliefs by ridiculing opponents who don&rsquo;t fully understand theirs &ndash; consider the plethora of &ldquo;Person X DESTROYS believer of Y&rdquo; videos online.</p><p>Given a large enough group however, there tend to be many people who have given careful time and consideration into why they believe what they believe. Thus, one cannot simply sweep a prominent idea under the rug because of a few bad apples. To do so is to throw away ideas which stood the test of time and the people behind them. If proposed a ridiculous sounding idea, merely dismissing it without consideration denies you of a potentially meaningful realization. Instead of &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s wrong&rdquo;, all parties benefit more from &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The pursuit of knowledge would have ended a long time ago if we dismissed everything we didn&rsquo;t believe.</p><h2 id=entertaining-thoughts>Entertaining Thoughts

This is essential for multiple reasons:</p><ol><li>By entertaining an idea, you can learn key takeaways from views that may appear ridiculous at first</li><li>You can reinforce your beliefs by attempting (and failing) to convince yourself of an opposing view</li></ol><p>Additionally, many people are absolutely rubbish at laying out a convincing argument. Requiring the persuasion of other people to change your mind will result in your mind rarely being changed. Sometimes, the best person to convince you of something is in fact, you.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts
