I run Arch Linux. Here&rsquo;s my experience:</p><ul><li><p>Upgrade was easy, but the cables for my WiFi card wouldn&rsquo;t snap into place. There&rsquo;s a plastic thing that I have to put on top of the connector to hold them in place, but it&rsquo;s a massive pain to connect. Took me over 20 minutes to align and lock the cables into place, but I got it working.</p></li><li><p>The website said the HX 370 mainboard was only compatible with the RZ717 WiFi card, but the RZ717 was out of stock when I bought my mainboard. When the WiFi card was back in stock, they wouldn&rsquo;t let me buy it without buying <em>another</em> mainboard. This is stupid, and I suspect just an innocent oversight on their part. I had to install my RZ616 to see if that was good enough.</p></li><li><p>On the new mainboard, the AMD RZ616 wifi card&rsquo;s drivers would disconnect me for hours at a time, essentially rendering my laptop unusable&mdash;not good when you&rsquo;re do coding interviews for a job. I reached out the customer support, they left me on read for about a week, so I just purchased an Intel AX210 non-vPro which works <em>perfectly</em>. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s great about a company like Framework: if their support is slow or unhelpful, you can fix your problems yourself.</p><ul><li>I posted about my customer support experience on Reddit, and even though the post didn&rsquo;t blow up, their support lead reached out to make sure I was taken care of. They really do seem to care&mdash;sometimes things just fall through the cracks.</li><li>Even though their customer support was slow, the initial response was still promising. I probably would have been taken care of, just after a few more weeks.</li><li>I think they should stop selling the AMD RZ WiFi cards, given their issues. I wish their website just told me to get the Intel AX210 non-vPro when I was buying the laptop.</li><li>It only took a few days to get the Intel AX210 non-vPro, which was nice. I&rsquo;d be a much less happy customer if that also took a month.</li></ul></li><li><p>Linux required some tinkering to get working, but ChatGPT was able to guide me through literally everything <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. I was literally dropping in the SSD from the previous mainboard without reinstalling, so I had some issues booting from the boot partition and needed to update <code>/etc/fstab</code>, so not an issue on Framework&rsquo;s end. Nothing a live USB couldn&rsquo;t fix.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It&rsquo;s so cool how I don&rsquo;t need to wait for a screwdriver from Amazon to replace any of the parts. Keep the included screwdriver in your backpack and you&rsquo;re always good to go.</p></li><li><p>Their documentation is <em>excellent</em>. Related: <a href=../../blog/take-the-road-most-documented>Take the Road Most Documented</a></p></li></ul><p>Overall, these shortcomings are to be expected from a small, growing company. The important thing is that there was a documented, non-hacky solution I could find and implement on my own. The actual upgrade was easy, the HX 370 mainboard is <em>fantastic</em>, and everything now works flawlessly.</p><p>Overall: 9/10 experience, would buy again.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I could write volumes about how useful ChatGPT is for debugging Linux issues. I generally know what I&rsquo;m doing, I just don&rsquo;t know the syntax for most of the commands. AI has read every single Linux question on the internet and is really <em>really</em> useful for identifying problems and suggesting solutions.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2025-07-07</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=../../blog/framework-13-upgrade-experience/>/blog/framework-13-upgrade-experience/</a>
