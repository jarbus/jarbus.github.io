People claim the issue with modern society is misinformation&mdash;stretched-truths, omission of crucial facts, and outright lies. While misinformation isn&rsquo;t great, humans can overcome it if they respect those with whom they disagree&mdash;at least enough to engage in good faith discussion.
The bigger issue is that we have horrible communication skills.
In the United States, many believe their political opposition is &ldquo;brain-washed&rdquo;&mdash;and for good reason. But in this democracy, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility not only to seek truth, but to spread it; needless to say, we are failing miserably on the latter."><link rel=icon type=image/png href=//localhost:1313/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed href=//localhost:1313/favicon.png><style>body{visibility:hidden;opacity:0}</style><noscript><style>body{visibility:visible;opacity:1}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=//localhost:1313/css/style.7206c671c084a2de44d9e8ad7492dc958fe5f117968b9100ca9440bf83a88046.css integrity="sha256-cgbGccCEot5E2eitdJLclY/l8ReWi5EAypRAv4OogEY="><script src=//localhost:1313/js/script.32e751300d2d69e2cb56a98d2c9d964d54a53a8fb7281ccdbd80f055c88e8d86.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-MudRMA0taeLLVqmNLJ2WTVSlOo+3KBzNvYDwVciOjYY="></script><meta property="og:url" content="//localhost:1313/blog/admit-when-you-are-wrong/"><meta property="og:title" content="Admit When You Are Wrong, Or Nobody Will Listen When You Are Right"><meta property="og:description" content="Despite everything, I still believe in free speech; I think we just need to improve our message.

But in this democracy, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility not only to seek truth, but to spread it; needless to say, we are failing miserably on the latter.</p><p>I think people have gotten so heated about small issues in the past that nobody listens when a big issue arises, like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf>the boy who cried wolf</a>. By alienating neighbors in times of prosperity, we don&rsquo;t listen to each other in times of crisis.</p><p>Take <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_salute_controversy>Elon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nazi Salute&rdquo;</a>. To anyone who doesn&rsquo;t already hate Elon, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe this to be a Nazi salute; it&rsquo;s completely reasonable to believe he is gesturing, &ldquo;my heart goes out to you&rdquo;. By seriously calling him a Nazi for something this small, <strong>you water down your language to the point where, when there is an actual Nazi, nobody will believe you.</strong></p><p>This is important, because there&rsquo;s really no other word stronger than &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; that we can use to show that we are <em>serious this time</em>&mdash;what would you call a real Nazi, a <em>super-nazi</em>?</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be the boy who cried wolf; words should hold weight.</strong></p><p>I talk to people on both ends of the political spectrum, and it&rsquo;s clear we need to work with these people if our nation is to survive. We <em>have</em> to believe that they aren&rsquo;t a lost cause&mdash;that we <em>can</em> get through to them with the right language, demeanor, and attitude. As righteous as it may feel, yelling, name-calling, and vandalism is going to have the opposite effect&mdash;people will shut down, get defensive, or ignore you; and when that happens, you lose.</p><p>The best way I&rsquo;ve found to connect with these people is to first acknowledge both what they&rsquo;ve been right about <em>and</em> what I&rsquo;ve been wrong about. The effect this has is remarkable; you go from being the enemy to being a thoughtful person who is willing to see their perpective. Only once you gain this trust will your words have weight in their mind.</p><p>For example, to which of the following statements do you think a Trump supporter will be more receptive?:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Elon and Trump are Nazis. They are kidnapping innocent legal residents and sending them who-knows-where. They are destroying our government, removing anyone who opposes them, manipulating the stock market, and destroying freedom of speech. They are pure evil.</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=2><li>I may have overreacted in the past. But he&rsquo;s crossed a line. He&rsquo;s kicking out students for expressing political opinions and fighting to keep innocent people locked up without due process. We are rapidly approaching Nazi Germany, and this should be raising alarms for all Americans.</li></ol></blockquote><p>People like agreeing to disagree; they like speaking with someone who can provide perspective while avoiding conflict; unfortunately, many of us are quick to anger.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2025-04-13</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=//localhost:1313/blog/admit-when-you-are-wrong/>//localhost:1313/blog/admit-when-you-are-wrong/</a>
