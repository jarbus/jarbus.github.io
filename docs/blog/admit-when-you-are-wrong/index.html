People claim the issue with modern society is misinformation&mdash;stretched-truths, omission of crucial facts, and outright lies. While misinformation isn&rsquo;t great, humans can overcome it if they respect those with whom they disagree&mdash;at least enough to engage in good faith discussion.
The bigger issue is that we have horrible communication skills.
In the United States, many believe their political opposition is &ldquo;brain-washed&rdquo;&mdash;and for good reason. But in this democracy, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility not only to seek truth, but to spread it. We are failing miserably on this."><link rel=icon type=image/png href=//localhost:1313/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed href=//localhost:1313/favicon.png><style>body{visibility:hidden;opacity:0}</style><noscript><style>body{visibility:visible;opacity:1}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=//localhost:1313/css/style.7de87c443261d4beb70d86b6e8937aea6081d45012f5106c1498d0776140b2f9.css integrity="sha256-feh8RDJh1L63DYa26JN66mCB1FAS9RBsFJjQd2FAsvk="><script src=//localhost:1313/js/script.32e751300d2d69e2cb56a98d2c9d964d54a53a8fb7281ccdbd80f055c88e8d86.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-MudRMA0taeLLVqmNLJ2WTVSlOo+3KBzNvYDwVciOjYY="></script><script src=//localhost:1313/js/script.4a16e98326ac7d578fd6cdf11f605726c5340c174cbac62e97fdad653bc80249.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-ShbpgyasfVeP1s3xH2BXJsU0DBdMusYul/2tZTvIAkk="></script><script src=//localhost:1313/js/script.87f73adc9c28cc24be101e2d384aaeb4b504f0d5303918ff2d02c286547cf6ac.js type=text/javascript integrity="sha256-h/c63JwozCS+EB4tOEqutLUE8NUwORj/LQLChlR89qw="></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]],displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],processEscapes:!0,processEnvironments:!0},options:{skipHtmlTags:["script","noscript","style","textarea","pre"]}},window.addEventListener("load",e=>{document.querySelectorAll("mjx-container").forEach(function(e){e.parentElement.classList+="has-jax"})})</script><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></head><body><a class=skip-main href=#main>Skip to main content</a><div class=container><header class=common-header><div class=header-top><h1 class=site-title><a href=//localhost:1313/></a></h1></div><img src=../../dithered-tree-contrast.gif alt="Dithered Tree" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;max-height:20vh"><nav><a href=//localhost:1313/ title=home>~jarbus</a>

But in this democracy, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility not only to seek truth, but to spread it. We are failing miserably on this.</p><p>I think people have gotten so heated about small issues in the past that nobody listens when a big issue arises, like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf>the boy who cried wolf</a>. By alienating neighbors in times of prosperity, we don&rsquo;t listen to each other in times of crisis.</p><p>Take <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_salute_controversy>Elon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nazi Salute&rdquo;</a>. To anyone who doesn&rsquo;t already hate Elon, there&rsquo;s no reason to believe this to be a Nazi salute; it&rsquo;s completely reasonable to believe he is gesturing, &ldquo;my heart goes out to you&rdquo;. By seriously calling him a Nazi for something this small, <strong>you water down your language to the point where, when there is an actual Nazi, nobody will believe you.</strong></p><p>This is important, because there&rsquo;s really no other word stronger than &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; that we can use to show that we are <em>serious this time</em>&mdash;what would you call a real Nazi, a <em>super-nazi</em>?</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be the boy who cried wolf; words should hold weight.</strong></p><p>I talk to people on both ends of the political spectrum, and it&rsquo;s clear we need to work with these people if our nation is to survive. We <em>have</em> to believe that they aren&rsquo;t a lost cause&mdash;that we <em>can</em> get through to them with the right language, demeanor, and attitude. As righteous as it may feel, yelling, name-calling, and vandalism will have the opposite effect&mdash;people will shut down, get defensive, or ignore you. When that happens, everyone loses.</p><p>The best way I&rsquo;ve found to connect with these people is to first acknowledge both what they&rsquo;ve been right about <em>and</em> what I&rsquo;ve been wrong about. The effect this has is remarkable; you go from being the enemy to being a thoughtful person who is willing to see their perpective. Only once you gain this trust will your words have weight in their mind.</p><p>People like agreeing to disagree; they like speaking with someone who can provide perspective while avoiding conflict; unfortunately, many of us are quick to anger.</p></div><div class=post-info><div class="post-date dt-published">2025-04-13</div><a class="post-hidden-url u-url" href=//localhost:1313/blog/admit-when-you-are-wrong/>//localhost:1313/blog/admit-when-you-are-wrong/</a>
