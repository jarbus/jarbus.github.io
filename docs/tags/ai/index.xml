Now, with AI in the hands of billions, there&amp;rsquo;s little value in copying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, take programming. Five years ago, building apps, websites, or games required a non-trivial amount of skill, and getting your first project off the ground was an accomplishment. Now, AI can generate most starter projects in hours, if not minutes. I think this decimates the reward, both internal and external, of actually completing the first few projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it&amp;rsquo;s less impressive, which, in my opinion, matters. We like the feeling of pride we get when we show our work to others, especially when just starting out. It&amp;rsquo;s sad to diminish the relative value of someone&amp;rsquo;s work when they are just starting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it&amp;rsquo;s less satisfying for us. For those who just want to build useful tools, modern technology is great. But, for those who want to feel a sense of reward for creating something, it&amp;rsquo;s sad, I think. There&amp;rsquo;s still lots to build, but for most projects, especially starter projects, the internal payoff&amp;rsquo;s been greatly diminished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might have long-term consequences, because to get to the point where you can build something truly original, you first have to build many things which are unoriginal. The end goal of making something new is still just as valuable, if not more so, but the journey to develop the skills and original voice seems more mundane than ever. I also suspect that the next generation, who learns from AI will be significantly less technically competent, as they may never need to understand the technology they are working with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this will place an upwards pressure on originality and novelty. Now that both the technical barrier to entry and the cost of producing unoriginal work is so low, society will start to value original ideas more than ever&amp;ndash;doubly so if we reduce the rewards of the journey towards becoming original and skilled. If the world becomes flooded with less original, less technical users of AI, the value of technical competence and originality will skyrocket.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emergent Trade and Tolerated Theft Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>//localhost:1313/blog/emergent-trade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 12:14:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>//localhost:1313/blog/emergent-trade/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been an author on a few papers before, but I recently published the first research project where I was responsible for most of the work and direction. It&amp;rsquo;s in the first 2024 issue of the journal &lt;em>Artificial Life&lt;/em>, which you can find &lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/artl_a_00423/119154/Emergent-Resource-Exchange-and-Tolerated-Theft">here&lt;/a>. You can find a non-paywalled version &lt;a href="../../trade-paper.pdf">here&lt;/a> Below, I tell the chronology of the project and summarize our findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../trade.gif" alt="Emergent Trade" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We explore the conditions under which trade can emerge between four deep reinforcement learning agents that pick up and put down resources in a 2D foraging environment. Agents are rewarded for having both resources once, but the resources are distributed far apart from each other. To maximize reward, agents need to split up the work - agent 1 goes to resource A, agent 2 goes to resource B, etc, and then they meet to exchange resources, since meeting halfway can get them the most of each resource in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was working on this for a while in isolation, getting nowhere, and slowly going crazy. A few months later, Deepmind published a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06760">paper&lt;/a> that explored this exact behavior&amp;mdash;and found that agents could not discover how to exchange goods without programming a trading system into the game mechanics directly. I was getting similar results, but found that this trading behavior could emerge if I rewarded agents for being physically close to one another, which we&amp;rsquo;ll call a &amp;ldquo;community bonus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reached out to the authors (great people btw), and they hypothesized that the trading behavior was a result of agents trying to keep each other alive to get the community bonus. In my setup, agents could die if they ran out of resources, so they were also keeping each other alive for company. The authors suggested I add some sort of &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo;, a place for agents to meet up and trade without getting directly rewarded for giving away resources for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They explored similar ideas in their work, and if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t get this behavior to emerge, what chance did I have? I needed to try something similar but sufficiently different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of adding a market where agents could come and go as they please, I added a campfire and a day-night cycle. I gave negative reward to agents for being out in the dark, which incentivizes them to gather around the campfire near others. Agents would only have enough time during the day to forage a single resource.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, agents really, &lt;em>really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn this behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for agents to get cheated out of the resources they offer by others who offer nothing in return, so they gather as much as possible on their own. They even forage at night if the darkness penalty isn&amp;rsquo;t severe enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, after 4+ days of training time, agents start to realize that working together isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad and land on a trading protocol where agents stand back, drop an offer, then walk over to collect the resources dropped by others. Experiments show that agents keep their distance initially so they can reclaim their offer if their trading partner attempts to cheat them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one trial, agents converge on a local minimum, where agents 1&amp;amp;2 go to the same area to collect resource A, agent 3 goes to collect resource B, and agent 4 collects a bit of the other remaining resources. In this setting, we notice a behavior which we dub &amp;ldquo;Tolerated Theft&amp;rdquo;. When agent 1 collects significantly more of resource A than agent 2, agent 2 tries to steal the resources exchanged between agents 1 and 3. To defend against this, agent 1 will drop some resources away from agent 3, to get agent 2 off their backs while they trade. This is particularly interesting, because an agent manages to &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; resources without us adding a combat or larceny system. Nature truly does find a way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend checking out the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01862">arxiv pre-print&lt;/a> if you are interested in the details and figures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Index</title><link>//localhost:1313/blog/ai-index/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:25:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>//localhost:1313/blog/ai-index/</guid><description>&lt;p>An ever-expanding list of concepts in the field of AI to give myself and others an easy reference.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>You cannot promise anything about your product.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen AI advertised to the masses that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as advertised, just look at any voice-to-text system. When I got my Apple Watch, I hoped to use it to respond to messages without getting distracted by my phone. I quickly realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a viable solution: I had to repeat my message multiple times per text in order to get the correct dictation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this was a software issue, I could file a bug report and Apple could send out a fix. Unfortunately with AI, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much Apple can do besides get more data and re-train the model, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee a better user experience for anyone. Mind you, this is with software that&amp;rsquo;s already shipped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at Tesla, or more specifically its CEO, Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy">Musk claims that Level 5 driving (in which a human is not needed behind the wheel) will be coming to Tesla vehicles in the form of a software update by the end of 2020&lt;/a>. A month before he made said claim, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-autopilot-slam-overturned-truck">a Tesla on autopilot crashed into a flipped truck&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;a mistake most humans wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like Apple can&amp;rsquo;t promise its speech-to-text system will work better than a human (or even better than a toddler), Musk can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee anything about Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Level 5 capability. Tesla can&amp;rsquo;t even &amp;ldquo;reasonably claim&amp;rdquo; your car won&amp;rsquo;t crash into flipped trucks or &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/another-tesla-crashes-into-a-cop-car-while-on-autopilot/ar-BB16Mvkk#!">stopped cop cars&lt;/a>. In fact, no one using deep learning can promise anything about their system. Deep learning, and by extension Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Autopilot system, is a black box. We don&amp;rsquo;t know why it works, we can&amp;rsquo;t promise that it&amp;rsquo;ll work, but it seems to work when we test it. Unless Tesla is testing on all roads in all conditions, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be &amp;ldquo;confident&amp;rdquo; level 5 technology, in which &lt;strong>a human does not need to be in the vehicle&lt;/strong>, is &amp;ldquo;around the corner&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autopilot-germany/german-court-bans-tesla-ad-statements-related-to-autonomous-driving-idUSKCN24F1T5">a court in Germany banned Tesla from including “full potential for autonomous driving” and “Autopilot inclusive” in its German advertising materials&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Full Self-Driving (FSD) update wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time Tesla over-promises and under-delivers. Consumer Reports described the company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Smart Summon&amp;rdquo; feature as &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/">&amp;ldquo;glitchy and at times worked intermittently&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. The damage with Smart Summon has been low, but a full-autonomy update could result in a few consequences:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tesla sold cars with the promise of Level 5 driving in the future: Not only is Tesla now under immense pressure to rush out a Level 5 update as soon as possible, but must do so using the hardware it sold customers years ago. Hopefully Level 5 doesn&amp;rsquo;t require LIDAR sensors (or any additional hardware) like Elon claims; because Tesla is expected to ship some version of FSD to users.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customers may end up in legal trouble if Tesla&amp;rsquo;s software fails them: Tesla avoids legal responsibility for buggy software by shifting responsibility of an accident to the driver. However, when Tesla sells millions of cars on the premise that users won&amp;rsquo;t have to manually drive them one day, should drivers be held responsible when that day comes and their car crashes?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Other companies have realized the high standards a Level 5 system should meet. Two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades">Waymo CEO John Krafcik claimed that true self-driving cars, that function everywhere under all circumstances, won&amp;rsquo;t be ubiquitous for decades&lt;/a>. As a result, Waymo shifted gears and placed its focus on rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona">autonomous taxis&lt;/a> on a city by city basis, starting in Pheonix, Arizona. This approach to Level 5 driving is much safer for the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waymo is minimizing the number of people at risk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is operating its vehicles strictly where they have been tested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is not selling consumers a technology that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is not relying on the average consumer to be attentive&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Level 5 technology can save thousands of lives and millions of dollars&amp;ndash;but it needs to be done to the same (if not higher) standards of automotive testing, and not the &amp;ldquo;move fast and break things&amp;rdquo; approach of Silicon Valley. Hopefully Tesla can safely deliver on its promise of full self driving soon, but if not, consumers may soon have a case to demand a refund.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization of a Neural Network</title><link>//localhost:1313/blog/visualization-of-a-basic-neural-network-in-python/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 11:25:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>//localhost:1313/blog/visualization-of-a-basic-neural-network-in-python/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> This article was originally published &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jackgarbus/visualization-of-a-basic-neural-network-in-python-7f1d6770f00b">on medium&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Building a neural network is a challenging task, but due to the abstract nature of neural nets it is entirely possible to program one without any understanding of how it works in its given context! In this article, we’ll attempt to understand what a neural network trained off of a portion of the MNIST database is actually looking for.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a simplified example of the 3 layer network that we will be visualizing. The input layer of 784 nodes represents the 784 pixels in our 28x28 image, the first hidden layer consists of 512 nodes, the second of 256, and the output layer of 10, as seen in the code below. The network outputs whichever number it believes it sees by activating a single node in the third layer, which corresponds to a number between 0–9.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We will be examining the weights of the network in an attempt to gain an understanding of what parts of an image each node in each layer is looking for. In this example, we will try and convert each pixel’s effect on whatever node we are visualizing to a gray scale value, and then display the set of all pixels as a grayscale image. To start, let’s look at the first hidden layer in our network, with a node count of 512. Here is the simplified image again:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/1.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each connection in the network represents the left node feeding it’s value multiplied by a weight to the right node. Each connection represents a different weight (although two nodes can also have the same weight). As you can see, each input value is multiplied by a weight and fed to each node in the first hidden layer. In other words, if our input layer is of size 784 (a flattened 28x28 image), then each node in the first hidden layer has 784 inputs. This results in visualization of the first hidden layer being relatively easy — if each weight corresponds directly to a unique input pixel, then we can just display each weight as a pixel itself! We can achieve this with the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/4.png" alt="model.layers[0] retrieves the first layer of our network, while .get_weights()[0] retrieves the weights, which are then added to the bias, .get_weights()[1]" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, we can’t directly visualize the 28x28 array of weights. First, weights can be negative, which means all of the negative weights would be clipped to 0 if we tried to display them in a grayscale image, and weights of -5 and -0.4 mean very different things. Additionally, we want our weights to be between 0 and 255, values for the 8-bit image matplotlib will be displaying. To do this, we will normalize our values, using the code below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/5.png" alt="We go over each node (length being the amount of nodes in the layer), normalize all the weights so the lowest is at 0 and the highest is at 255, and then convert them to integers." loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normalization of weights is not a perfect representation of a node’s function however. For example, the weights could all be negative, which means the node would never activate, but it would still appear in the visualization as a variety of weights from 0–255 after normalizing them. However, this is still indicative of what the node is looking for (more or less), and many of the nodes activate one way or the other, so normalization still gives some very key insights that we wouldn’t have otherwise, especially if weights are very close together and would be hard to differentiate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After throwing some matplotlib functions at the first layer images, we get 512 images, a fraction of which can be seen below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/6.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This all seems like random noise, but when each of these nodes are multiplied by an additional weight, we start to get “feature detectors”, which we’ll explore in the second hidden layer.So don’t think of these images to be representative of anything, but rather data that only the second layer can make any sense out of. Speaking of that second layer…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="from-first-hidden-layer-to-the-second-hidden-layer" >From First Hidden Layer to The Second Hidden Layer
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#from-first-hidden-layer-to-the-second-hidden-layer">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hidden Layer 2 (or 1, if you start counting layers from 0 like Keras does) is composed of 256 nodes, each receiving the data from each of the nodes in Layer 1. However, this layer isn’t receiving input in the form of a single array of 784 values like the first layer. Instead each node is receiving 512 inputs, the activations of the nodes in the first layer. If this is the case, then how do we turn 512 weights into a representation of what our network looks for in a given 28x28 image?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember, each of those 512 inputs correspond to a set of 784 weights representing a certain 28x28 image the network is looking for, as seen in the previous section. This means that if a node in the second hidden layer receives 512 inputs, each input represents the 28x28 image that the corresponding node in the first hidden layer is looking for, with each input receiving a different weight. Since each node in a network just adds up each input multiplied by a weight, we can visualize these nodes by multiplying each image by it’s corresponding weight, and adding these weighted images up to get a generalized 28x28 visualization of that second node!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This process turns out to be equivalent to a dot product, which multiplies two matrices by multiplying components them summing them up. Keras stores our weights in the form of a nice little array 2 dimensional array for any given layer. In our first layer, it was in the form of a 784x512 array, each row of the array representing all the weights for a given input node. Additionally, this is why we had to transpose it for visualization by adding a .T to the end of our weights matrix, to convert it to a 512x784 array where each row represented an output node. We can take the non-transposed weight matrix, of size 784x512, and dot it (multiply each image by it’s weight and add up the images) with the second layer weight matrix, of size 512x256, to get a new weight matrix of size 784x256, which we can transpose to get the final matrix for this layer of size 256x784, with each row representing a node in our second hidden layer and each column the weight of each pixel that node uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/7.png" alt="We un-transpose our previously calculated matrix, and dot it with the weights from our second layer, to get a new matrix of (784x512 x 512x256).T = 256x784" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After normalization, we can then perform the same matplotlib magic to plot these new images, which look a little something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/8.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not quite what we are looking for, but we can start to see different regions of the image that the network is looking for. However, the magic really happens when the nodes are pieced together in the final layer.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We have now achieved a 256x784 matrix of images. Using the same process we used for layer two, we can transpose the images (again) we used previously to get a 784x256 matrix, which we can then dot with our 256x10 matrix of weights we use in our third layer to achieve a 784x10 matrix, which we can then dot one &lt;strong>last time&lt;/strong> to get a 10x784 matrix, where each row represents what our third layer is looking for. Let’s take a look after training the network on 500 images (as there is a much less obvious visualization when thousands are used):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/9.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, we can somewhat make out the number each node is trying to detect! This is not only useful for seeing what the network looks for, but also understanding how it extrapolates it’s results in the first place. For example, when the network is trained on 60,000 images, an interesting pattern emerges:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/10.png" alt="" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The network learns that, for a large portion of the MNIST dataset used in Keras, certain areas of the images are only ever written on by one or two numbers. For example, few numbers ever reach the very bottom right of the image except for 9, and bottom left for the numbers 7 and 9, as you can see in the image below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/3.png" alt="Sample images from the MNIST database" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason the above images display a line towards the bottom is because it tries to “catch” any writing at the bottom, and can eliminate any number that is not a 7 or a 9. Similar patterns emerge for other numbers, which helps indicate that not only does a network need a large variety of data to gain a “more accurate” understanding, but that it will always go for the easiest route to achieve the highest accuracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-multi-layer-network-isnt-always-needed" >A Multi-Layer Network Isn’t Always Needed
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#a-multi-layer-network-isnt-always-needed">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to visualization of the network with two hidden layers, I tried to see what is possible for a network with no hidden layers to accomplish, given the same data. I tweaked the model above to only have 784 inputs and 10 outputs, a direct mapping of pixels to the expected number. Using the same process for visualizing the first hidden layer, the network produced some pleasantly surprising results:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="resources/11.png" alt="Output nodes 0–9 visualized in a single layer network" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see, despite having a less complex design than the multi-layer network seen above, this visualization demonstrates the power of a single node. The network demonstrates a very clear understanding of what it believes each number “looks like”, with an (arguably) more accurate understanding than the multi-layer design. These results show the idea that more nodes doesn’t always translate to more understanding, and that the power of a network is less about the number of nodes and more about the design/data used to train.&lt;/p>
