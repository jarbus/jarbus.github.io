      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been an author on a few papers before, but I recently published the first research project where I was responsible for most of the work and direction. It&amp;rsquo;s in the first 2024 issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Artificial Life&lt;/em&gt;, which you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/artl_a_00423/119154/Emergent-Resource-Exchange-and-Tolerated-Theft&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (I&amp;rsquo;ll post camera-ready paper here later this year, but for now, you can view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01862&#34;&gt;pre-print on arxiv&lt;/a&gt;. Below, I tell the chronology of the project and summarize our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../trade.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore the conditions under which trade can emerge between four deep reinforcement learning agents that pick up and put down resources in a 2D foraging environment. Agents are rewarded for having both resources once, but the resources are distributed far apart from each other. To maximize reward, agents need to split up the work - agent 1 goes to resource A, agent 2 goes to resource B, etc, and then they meet to exchange resources, since meeting halfway can get them the most of each resource in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on this for a while in isolation, getting nowhere, and slowly going crazy. A few months later, Deepmind published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06760&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that explored this exact behavior&amp;mdash;and found that agents could not discover how to exchange goods without programming a trading system into the game mechanics directly. I was getting similar results, but found that this trading behavior could emerge if I rewarded agents for being physically close to one another, which we&amp;rsquo;ll call a &amp;ldquo;community bonus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to the authors (great people btw), and they hypothesized that the trading behavior was a result of agents trying to keep each other alive to get the community bonus. In my setup, agents could die if they ran out of resources, so they were also keeping each other alive for company. The authors suggested I add some sort of &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo;, a place for agents to meet up and trade without getting directly rewarded for giving away resources for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They explored similar ideas in their work, and if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t get this behavior to emerge, what chance did I have? I needed to try something similar but sufficiently different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of adding a market where agents could come and go as they please, I added a campfire and a day-night cycle. I gave negative reward to agents for being out in the dark, which incentivizes them to gather around the campfire near others. Agents would only have enough time during the day to forage a single resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, agents really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn this behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for agents to get cheated out of the resources they offer by others who offer nothing in return, so they gather as much as possible on their own. They even forage at night if the darkness penalty isn&amp;rsquo;t severe enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after 4+ days of training time, agents start to realize that working together isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad and land on a trading protocol where agents stand back, drop an offer, then walk over to collect the resources dropped by others. Experiments show that agents keep their distance initially so they can reclaim their offer if their trading partner attempts to cheat them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one trial, agents converge on a local minimum, where agents 1&amp;amp;2 go to the same area to collect resource A, agent 3 goes to collect resource B, and agent 4 collects a bit of the other remaining resources. In this setting, we notice a behavior which we dub &amp;ldquo;Tolerated Theft&amp;rdquo;. When agent 1 collects significantly more of resource A than agent 2, agent 2 tries to steal the resources exchanged between agents 1 and 3. To defend against this, agent 1 will drop some resources away from agent 3, to get agent 2 off their backs while they trade. This is particularly interesting, because an agent manages to &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; resources without us adding a combat or larceny system. Nature truly does find a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend checking out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01862&#34;&gt;arxiv pre-print&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in the details and figures.&lt;/p&gt;

They are primarly used to extract the useful properties from data automatically. They can do this in an unsupervised fashion, since their output targets are the given input, requiring no labeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\gamma = 0$ cares only about immediate reward,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\gamma = 1$ cares only about sum of all future rewards.&lt;/li&gt;

A simple example is &lt;a href=&#34;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&#34;&gt;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&lt;/a&gt;, that can generate fake pictures of humans.
- GANs consist of one generator network with the goal to make realistic new data, and a distinction network with the goal to tell real data from fake. As the networks train, they each improve at their individual task, forcing their adversaries to improve in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, the outcome of one coin flip does not affect the outcome of another coin flip, so both flips are IID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dibyaghosh.com/blog/probability/kldivergence.html&#34;&gt;KL Divergence&lt;/a&gt;: Divergence between two distributions of data. Useful for determining how different fake data is from real data (GANs) or for determining how differemt two policies are for trust-based reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;

A unique trait of these networks are their memory cells&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;forget gates&amp;rdquo;, which allow them to control how long they hold onto data for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://deepai.org/publication/the-lottery-ticket-hypothesis-training-pruned-neural-networks&#34;&gt;The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;: A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialised such that — when trained in isolation — it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process&#34;&gt;Markov Decision Process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;W&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;: A system of states, actions, and probabilities of getting to other states given actions taken from previous states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aiden.nibali.org/blog/2017-01-18-mode-collapse-gans/&#34;&gt;Mode Collapse&lt;/a&gt;: When the distribution of samples produced by a generative adversarial network represent a subset of the latent distribution, instead of the entire latent distribution. For example, you train a network to produce pictures of animals but it only learns to produce pictures of cats.&lt;/p&gt;

In this problem, expected gain must be maximized in an environment with varying rewards, forcing an agent to decide between keeping an option they know to be safe versus exploring new options that might be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/897/online-vs-offline-learning&#34;&gt;Online/Offline Learning&lt;/a&gt;: Online learning happens as data comes in. Offline learning happens after data is collected and made into a batch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tesla and False Advertising in AI</title>
      <link>/blog/tesla-and-false-advertising-in-ai/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 11:25:49 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/tesla-and-false-advertising-in-ai/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem with advertising AI-based technology that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot promise anything about your product.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen AI advertised to the masses that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as advertised, just look at any voice-to-text system. When I got my Apple Watch, I hoped to use it to respond to messages without getting distracted by my phone. I quickly realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a viable solution: I had to repeat my message multiple times per text in order to get the correct dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was a software issue, I could file a bug report and Apple could send out a fix. Unfortunately with AI, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much Apple can do besides get more data and re-train the model, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee a better user experience for anyone. Mind you, this is with software that&amp;rsquo;s already shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at Tesla, or more specifically its CEO, Elon Musk. &lt;a href=&#34;https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy&#34;&gt;Musk claims that Level 5 driving (in which a human is not needed behind the wheel) will be coming to Tesla vehicles in the form of a software update by the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. A month before he made said claim, &lt;a href=&#34;https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-autopilot-slam-overturned-truck&#34;&gt;a Tesla on autopilot crashed into a flipped truck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;a mistake most humans wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Apple can&amp;rsquo;t promise its speech-to-text system will work better than a human (or even better than a toddler), Musk can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee anything about Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Level 5 capability. Tesla can&amp;rsquo;t even &amp;ldquo;reasonably claim&amp;rdquo; your car won&amp;rsquo;t crash into flipped trucks or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/another-tesla-crashes-into-a-cop-car-while-on-autopilot/ar-BB16Mvkk#!&#34;&gt;stopped cop cars&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, no one using deep learning can promise anything about their system. Deep learning, and by extension Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Autopilot system, is a black box. We don&amp;rsquo;t know why it works, we can&amp;rsquo;t promise that it&amp;rsquo;ll work, but it seems to work when we test it. Unless Tesla is testing on all roads in all conditions, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be &amp;ldquo;confident&amp;rdquo; level 5 technology, in which &lt;strong&gt;a human does not need to be in the vehicle&lt;/strong&gt;, is &amp;ldquo;around the corner&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autopilot-germany/german-court-bans-tesla-ad-statements-related-to-autonomous-driving-idUSKCN24F1T5&#34;&gt;a court in Germany banned Tesla from including “full potential for autonomous driving” and “Autopilot inclusive” in its German advertising materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Full Self-Driving (FSD) update wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time Tesla over-promises and under-delivers. Consumer Reports described the company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Smart Summon&amp;rdquo; feature as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;glitchy and at times worked intermittently&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The damage with Smart Summon has been low, but a full-autonomy update could result in a few consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla sold cars with the promise of Level 5 driving in the future: Not only is Tesla now under immense pressure to rush out a Level 5 update as soon as possible, but must do so using the hardware it sold customers years ago. Hopefully Level 5 doesn&amp;rsquo;t require LIDAR sensors (or any additional hardware) like Elon claims; because Tesla is expected to ship some version of FSD to users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers may end up in legal trouble if Tesla&amp;rsquo;s software fails them: Tesla avoids legal responsibility for buggy software by shifting responsibility of an accident to the driver. However, when Tesla sells millions of cars on the premise that users won&amp;rsquo;t have to manually drive them one day, should drivers be held responsible when that day comes and their car crashes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies have realized the high standards a Level 5 system should meet. Two years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades&#34;&gt;Waymo CEO John Krafcik claimed that true self-driving cars, that function everywhere under all circumstances, won&amp;rsquo;t be ubiquitous for decades&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, Waymo shifted gears and placed its focus on rolling out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona&#34;&gt;autonomous taxis&lt;/a&gt; on a city by city basis, starting in Pheonix, Arizona. This approach to Level 5 driving is much safer for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo is minimizing the number of people at risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo is operating its vehicles strictly where they have been tested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo is not selling consumers a technology that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waymo is not relying on the average consumer to be attentive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 5 technology can save thousands of lives and millions of dollars&amp;ndash;but it needs to be done to the same (if not higher) standards of automotive testing, and not the &amp;ldquo;move fast and break things&amp;rdquo; approach of Silicon Valley. Hopefully Tesla can safely deliver on its promise of full self driving soon, but if not, consumers may soon have a case to demand a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
