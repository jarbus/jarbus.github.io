&lt;p>We are reaching a familiar bottleneck in AI. Previously, humans had to manually hardcode the patterns that AI could recognize. With deep learning, machines began to learn patterns on their own, without human assistance. With (relatively) expensive humans out of the loop, we threw machines at the world&amp;rsquo;s data until they began to talk, code, and paint. Many people believed this would be sufficient to reach artificial super intelligence&amp;ndash;but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We ran out of data. Luckily, our newborn bots could talk 24/7&amp;ndash;not just to hundreds of millions of people, but also to other programs. These programs would ask the bots questions, verify their answer, and then use the correct answers to further improve the models. Free, infinite data. If the world&amp;rsquo;s data wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, then infinite data must be&amp;ndash;but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now watching the rise of reasoners&amp;ndash;models that &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo; before giving an answer. Models which generate a series of words to raise the probability of eventually producing something we want. Surely, &lt;em>surely&lt;/em>, this is it. Once we train a model to reason, it will be able to reason about its own answers, and somehow, magically, self-improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This infinite self-improvement probably won&amp;rsquo;t happen. In the same way that a fixed amount of mass can&amp;rsquo;t produce infinite energy, I suspect a fixed amount of information can&amp;rsquo;t produce infinite intelligence, no matter how much we feed it back into itself. Fundamentally, a model needs information from the outside, whether that information is a response from an external system or a human filtering its prior output for quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We provide some external information using formal verification systems, which is why math and programming performace is the &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">prominent flex&lt;/a> from the latest models. But most domains, like biology, business, and rocket science, are not so lucky; the correct answer is rarely obvious, even for programming. How does one automatically verify an interface is easy to use?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer still comes down to humans. Much to the dismay of a few arrogant men in San Francisco, people are still a key ingredient. This time, we don&amp;rsquo;t merely tell machines what patterns to look for; rather, we filter synthetic data to &amp;ldquo;steer&amp;rdquo; the model towards answers we prefer, i.e, we tell them what patterns to look for, but cheaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, if the right mixture of curated data could yield superintelligence, it would have&amp;ndash;models are now &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948v1">crushing benchmarks which PhDs struggle on&lt;/a>. This is ridiculous. We&amp;rsquo;re going wring these models of performance until they&amp;rsquo;re dry, and even then they won&amp;rsquo;t be superintelligent. Aside from extending formal verification, the way forward still seems to be curating the reasoning data these models generate and feeding it back in. As chains of reasoning become longer and more complex, human-curated data will likely yield increasingly diminishing returns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be approaching the limit of what these systems can do. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, they can do a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em>&amp;ndash;they&amp;rsquo;re basically magic&amp;ndash;but they can&amp;rsquo;t generally self-improve without humans or verifiers. And honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what else comes next besides self-improving AI. We don&amp;rsquo;t know what that looks like&amp;ndash;maybe some &lt;a href="https://puffer.ai/">multiagent game-playing system&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;but whatever it is, it will be the last. For real, this time. Probably.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upwards Pressure on Originality</title><link>/blog/upwards-pressure-on-originality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2024 09:23:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>/blog/upwards-pressure-on-originality/</guid><description>&lt;p>It used to be good enough just to copy others. Now, with AI in the hands of billions, there&amp;rsquo;s little value in copying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, take programming. Five years ago, building apps, websites, or games required a non-trivial amount of skill, and getting your first project off the ground was an accomplishment. Now, AI can generate most starter projects in hours, if not minutes. I think this decimates the reward, both internal and external, of actually completing the first few projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, it&amp;rsquo;s less impressive, which, in my opinion, matters. We like the feeling of pride we get when we show our work to others, especially when just starting out. It&amp;rsquo;s sad to diminish the relative value of someone&amp;rsquo;s work when they are just starting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it&amp;rsquo;s less satisfying for us. For those who just want to build useful tools, modern technology is great. But, for those who want to feel a sense of reward for creating something, it&amp;rsquo;s sad, I think. There&amp;rsquo;s still lots to build, but for most projects, especially starter projects, the internal payoff&amp;rsquo;s been greatly diminished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might have long-term consequences, because to get to the point where you can build something truly original, you first have to build many things which are unoriginal. The end goal of making something new is still just as valuable, if not more so, but the journey to develop the skills and original voice seems more mundane than ever. I also suspect that the next generation, who learns from AI will be significantly less technically competent, as they may never need to understand the technology they are working with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this will place an upwards pressure on originality and novelty. Now that both the technical barrier to entry and the cost of producing unoriginal work is so low, society will start to value original ideas more than ever&amp;ndash;doubly so if we reduce the rewards of the journey towards becoming original and skilled. If the world becomes flooded with less original, less technical users of AI, the value of technical competence and originality will skyrocket.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emergent Trade and Tolerated Theft Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>/blog/emergent-trade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2024 12:14:25 -0500</pubDate><guid>/blog/emergent-trade/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been an author on a few papers before, but I recently published the first research project where I was responsible for most of the work and direction. It&amp;rsquo;s in the first 2024 issue of the journal &lt;em>Artificial Life&lt;/em>, which you can find &lt;a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/artl_a_00423/119154/Emergent-Resource-Exchange-and-Tolerated-Theft">here&lt;/a>. You can find a non-paywalled version &lt;a href="../../trade-paper.pdf">here&lt;/a> Below, I tell the chronology of the project and summarize our findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../trade.gif" alt="Emergent Trade" loading="lazy">
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We explore the conditions under which trade can emerge between four deep reinforcement learning agents that pick up and put down resources in a 2D foraging environment. Agents are rewarded for having both resources once, but the resources are distributed far apart from each other. To maximize reward, agents need to split up the work - agent 1 goes to resource A, agent 2 goes to resource B, etc, and then they meet to exchange resources, since meeting halfway can get them the most of each resource in the shortest amount of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was working on this for a while in isolation, getting nowhere, and slowly going crazy. A few months later, Deepmind published a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06760">paper&lt;/a> that explored this exact behavior&amp;mdash;and found that agents could not discover how to exchange goods without programming a trading system into the game mechanics directly. I was getting similar results, but found that this trading behavior could emerge if I rewarded agents for being physically close to one another, which we&amp;rsquo;ll call a &amp;ldquo;community bonus&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reached out to the authors (great people btw), and they hypothesized that the trading behavior was a result of agents trying to keep each other alive to get the community bonus. In my setup, agents could die if they ran out of resources, so they were also keeping each other alive for company. The authors suggested I add some sort of &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo;, a place for agents to meet up and trade without getting directly rewarded for giving away resources for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They explored similar ideas in their work, and if they couldn&amp;rsquo;t get this behavior to emerge, what chance did I have? I needed to try something similar but sufficiently different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of adding a market where agents could come and go as they please, I added a campfire and a day-night cycle. I gave negative reward to agents for being out in the dark, which incentivizes them to gather around the campfire near others. Agents would only have enough time during the day to forage a single resource.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, agents really, &lt;em>really&lt;/em> don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn this behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s easy for agents to get cheated out of the resources they offer by others who offer nothing in return, so they gather as much as possible on their own. They even forage at night if the darkness penalty isn&amp;rsquo;t severe enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, after 4+ days of training time, agents start to realize that working together isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad and land on a trading protocol where agents stand back, drop an offer, then walk over to collect the resources dropped by others. Experiments show that agents keep their distance initially so they can reclaim their offer if their trading partner attempts to cheat them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one trial, agents converge on a local minimum, where agents 1&amp;amp;2 go to the same area to collect resource A, agent 3 goes to collect resource B, and agent 4 collects a bit of the other remaining resources. In this setting, we notice a behavior which we dub &amp;ldquo;Tolerated Theft&amp;rdquo;. When agent 1 collects significantly more of resource A than agent 2, agent 2 tries to steal the resources exchanged between agents 1 and 3. To defend against this, agent 1 will drop some resources away from agent 3, to get agent 2 off their backs while they trade. This is particularly interesting, because an agent manages to &amp;ldquo;steal&amp;rdquo; resources without us adding a combat or larceny system. Nature truly does find a way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen AI advertised to the masses that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as advertised, just look at any voice-to-text system. When I got my Apple Watch, I hoped to use it to respond to messages without getting distracted by my phone. I quickly realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a viable solution: I had to repeat my message multiple times per text in order to get the correct dictation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this was a software issue, I could file a bug report and Apple could send out a fix. Unfortunately with AI, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much Apple can do besides get more data and re-train the model, which still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee a better user experience for anyone. Mind you, this is with software that&amp;rsquo;s already shipped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at Tesla, or more specifically its CEO, Elon Musk. &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-tesla-close-level-5-autonomy">Musk claims that Level 5 driving (in which a human is not needed behind the wheel) will be coming to Tesla vehicles in the form of a software update by the end of 2020&lt;/a>. A month before he made said claim, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-autopilot-slam-overturned-truck">a Tesla on autopilot crashed into a flipped truck&lt;/a>&amp;ndash;a mistake most humans wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like Apple can&amp;rsquo;t promise its speech-to-text system will work better than a human (or even better than a toddler), Musk can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee anything about Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Level 5 capability. Tesla can&amp;rsquo;t even &amp;ldquo;reasonably claim&amp;rdquo; your car won&amp;rsquo;t crash into flipped trucks or &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/another-tesla-crashes-into-a-cop-car-while-on-autopilot/ar-BB16Mvkk#!">stopped cop cars&lt;/a>. In fact, no one using deep learning can promise anything about their system. Deep learning, and by extension Tesla&amp;rsquo;s Autopilot system, is a black box. We don&amp;rsquo;t know why it works, we can&amp;rsquo;t promise that it&amp;rsquo;ll work, but it seems to work when we test it. Unless Tesla is testing on all roads in all conditions, they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be &amp;ldquo;confident&amp;rdquo; level 5 technology, in which &lt;strong>a human does not need to be in the vehicle&lt;/strong>, is &amp;ldquo;around the corner&amp;rdquo;. That&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-autopilot-germany/german-court-bans-tesla-ad-statements-related-to-autonomous-driving-idUSKCN24F1T5">a court in Germany banned Tesla from including “full potential for autonomous driving” and “Autopilot inclusive” in its German advertising materials&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Full Self-Driving (FSD) update wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time Tesla over-promises and under-delivers. Consumer Reports described the company&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Smart Summon&amp;rdquo; feature as &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/automotive-technology/teslas-smart-summon-performance-doesnt-match-marketing-hype/">&amp;ldquo;glitchy and at times worked intermittently&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. The damage with Smart Summon has been low, but a full-autonomy update could result in a few consequences:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tesla sold cars with the promise of Level 5 driving in the future: Not only is Tesla now under immense pressure to rush out a Level 5 update as soon as possible, but must do so using the hardware it sold customers years ago. Hopefully Level 5 doesn&amp;rsquo;t require LIDAR sensors (or any additional hardware) like Elon claims; because Tesla is expected to ship some version of FSD to users.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customers may end up in legal trouble if Tesla&amp;rsquo;s software fails them: Tesla avoids legal responsibility for buggy software by shifting responsibility of an accident to the driver. However, when Tesla sells millions of cars on the premise that users won&amp;rsquo;t have to manually drive them one day, should drivers be held responsible when that day comes and their car crashes?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Other companies have realized the high standards a Level 5 system should meet. Two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/waymo-ceo-says-self-driving-cars-won-t-be-ubiqitious-for-decades">Waymo CEO John Krafcik claimed that true self-driving cars, that function everywhere under all circumstances, won&amp;rsquo;t be ubiquitous for decades&lt;/a>. As a result, Waymo shifted gears and placed its focus on rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona">autonomous taxis&lt;/a> on a city by city basis, starting in Pheonix, Arizona. This approach to Level 5 driving is much safer for the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Waymo is minimizing the number of people at risk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is operating its vehicles strictly where they have been tested.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is not selling consumers a technology that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waymo is not relying on the average consumer to be attentive&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Level 5 technology can save thousands of lives and millions of dollars&amp;ndash;but it needs to be done to the same (if not higher) standards of automotive testing, and not the &amp;ldquo;move fast and break things&amp;rdquo; approach of Silicon Valley. Hopefully Tesla can safely deliver on its promise of full self driving soon, but if not, consumers may soon have a case to demand a refund.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
