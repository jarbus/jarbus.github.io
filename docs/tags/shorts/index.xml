&lt;p>Looking to his right, Jeff noticed his old hooded friend where he left him; on his living-room rocking chair. The cold metal scythe still in his lap, the skeleton hadn&amp;rsquo;t moved an inch from where he left him earlier that morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s cooking, big guy?&amp;rdquo; Jeff said as he walked to the kitchen to grab his last can of Budweiser. His boney companioned turned his head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Oh, you know&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, Death emitted. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>still out of work.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>I do not understand why you still haven&amp;rsquo;t given up yet.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I could say the same about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>I exist for one purpose, Jeffrey. and as long as you are alive, I cannot rest.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, you seem pretty well rested to me, what with you never leaving my house and all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>I used to have what you call a &amp;lsquo;job&amp;rsquo;. It was very fulfilling, Jeffery. Took up all of my time. Do you want to know what it was?&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeffery took a sip of his beer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>I used to collect the souls of the dead, Jeffery. It was wonderful. I conversed with the rich, the poor, the young and the old, Jeffrey, as they contemplated life and where they were headed. I had, what you would call, a &amp;rsquo;nice thing going.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;All good things gotta come to an end.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Then you came along,&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death continued, ignoring him, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>and ruined everything.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It be like that sometimes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>It does not &amp;lsquo;be&amp;rsquo; like that sometimes, Jeffrey&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death glared, a purple glow forming in his eye sockets. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>A single human does not wipe out humanity &amp;rsquo;every now and then&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Fair.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>What is even more despicable,&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death proceeded, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>is that you don&amp;rsquo;t even regret pushing the button.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t really think about it too much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>YOU HAD A CHOICE,&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death boomed, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>BETWEEN SAVING HUMANKIND, AND SAVING YOURSELF&amp;ndash;&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Mhm.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>AND WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, DOOMED YOUR ENTIRE SPECIES&amp;ndash;&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yup.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>&amp;ndash;IN EXCHANGE FOR A LIFE OF THEFT AND SLUMBER.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t steal from the dead,&amp;rdquo; Jeff rebutted, taking another sip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>THAT IS NOT THE POINT, JEFFREY&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death bellowed. He paused, taking a few seconds to decompose himself. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>You fail to understand the magnitude of your actions.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh, I understand perfectly well, you&amp;rsquo;ve made sure of that. I&amp;rsquo;d have to be deaf to spend a day with you and not hear your whining.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe you even have a soul worth collecting.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Listen, it was self defense, alright? It&amp;rsquo;s not like I wanted to kill everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Osama Bin Laden; every single corrupt soul in your history books would not have stooped to your level; self-defense does not justify genocide.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So humans can drive thousands of species to extinction for selfish gain, but only when it happens to them it&amp;rsquo;s unjustified.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Death moved as if to rebutt, but said nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Do you know how close we came to nuclear war? There was never a guarantee of tomorrow for anyone. For all we know, the human race might last an extra few decades thanks to me.&amp;rdquo; Jeff said, smirking. &amp;ldquo;Why does humanity deserves the benefit of the doubt?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Why do you?&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily,&amp;rdquo; Jeff said, taking a seat on the opposite couch. &amp;ldquo;It just happened to be my choice. My parents were already dead&amp;ndash;I didn&amp;rsquo;t owe anybody anything. What moral rule says I &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to lay down my life for those I don&amp;rsquo;t know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>You are selfish, Jeffrey Johnson.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Death said, rising from his seat. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>You put yourself in front of millions of good, innocent people who would lay down their lives in your situation.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is it selfish, or simply not being selfless? A starving man doesn&amp;rsquo;t owe another starving man his bread.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Death leaned forward, skull to face with Jeff, searching for any sign of remorse. He came back empty. Death turned around drifted towards the exit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>He owes the guilt of denying a meal,&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; he remarked as he left the room. The front door creaked open, then closed. Silence filled the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Should I instead spend humanity&amp;rsquo;s last years crying?&amp;rdquo; Jeff yelled to the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The door didn&amp;rsquo;t respond.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
