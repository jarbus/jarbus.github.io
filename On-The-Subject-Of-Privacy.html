The rise of targeted advertising increases the demand for knowledge on consumer lifestyles. This knowledge enables mega-corporations to predict the likelihood a consumer will purchase a product because of an ad. Let’s look at the pros and cons of such a trend.</p> <p id="header2"> The Pros:</p> <p>The advertisement industry, like all industries, is subject to the law of supply and demand. Targeted advertising drastically reduces the cost of reaching a target audience, lowering the barrier to entry for competitors with smaller marketing budgets. This increases competition on a global scale, giving start-ups and other smaller companies the ability to reach the same audience as a mega-corp for an affordable price. </p> <p>- Note that since we rarely view internet ads for more than a few seconds, mega-corps can still spam advertisements in ways that smaller competitors can not. This does not increase the breadth of their reach, but rather the depth.</p> <p>The massive profits reaped from hosting targeted online advertisements also enable many more “free” services we take for granted. Internet standards such as free and rapid access to information and communication come at a cost, but luckily not in a way that restricts accessibility for lower classes. While non-profit organizations that rely on donations such as Wikipedia are viable, I doubt projects like Google Search, Google Maps, Facebook and YouTube could sustain themselves at such a scale while maintaining their “quality.” If every major service required donations to operate, it’s possible that projects such as Wikipedia might receive fewer donations because of the increase in other non-profit organizations.</p> <p>- Note that free and/or profitable privacy-focused alternatives to the projects mentioned above exist, such as DuckDuckGo, OpenStreetMap, Mastodon, and PeerTube. However, they operate at significantly smaller scales and are not subject to the higher-standards of regular consumers who demand better prediction services, more features, faster updates, and better support teams.</p> <p id="header2"> The Cons:</p> <p>It’s creepy, very creepy. Many people, myself included, don’t fully understand the extent of information collected on them. The profiles some companies create is not only accurate but can include details that are better left forgotten. Google and Facebook follow you around the internet as you browse (a technique called Fingerprinting), resulting in many people handing over data to companies whose services they thought they weren’t using. Pro-privacy settings are always disabled by default, and some companies outright disable services if they don’t feel like they are getting enough user data to justify it (looking at you, Google Web and App activity.)</p> <p>The addition of surveillance technology can degrade many services and products. Webpages take longer to load due to all the trackers they come with, which also burns through cellular data faster. Background information collection processes like reporting location data can also drain battery life in cell phones.</p> <p>Governments can and do order companies to hand over user data whilst placing a gag-order to prevent said company from notifying the user impacted. This warrantless seizure of private information occurs thousands of times a year in dozens of countries.</p> <hr> <p>Who cares, though? So what if corporations track everything I do to serve personalized ads? What if I enjoy seeing products I’m interested in instead of products that don‘t apply to my demographic at all? What if the companies use that data to better serve me? Are you really going to tell me I’m wrong?</p> <p>Nope. It’s perfectly fine to trade privacy for convenience if that’s your thing, especially if having the government go through your message history doesn’t creep you out. Honestly, I wouldn’t blame you; The stuff some companies can do with your data is amazing. Google Search’s prediction and accuracy is second to none, but it‘s a feature I’m willing to lose when I switch to DuckDuckGo, which is good enough most of the time.</p> <p>Keep in mind that while there might not be any serious consequences to sacrificing privacy today, times can change. The Red Scare happened in the United States — a country lauded for it‘s freedom, — less than 100 years ago. Due to shifts in the political climate, people expressing their freedom of speech were jailed for their beliefs. Back then, people were lucky — if one wanted to hide their thoughts, they just had to shut up. But now? The government could request a list of all persons with communist beliefs, and Google/Facebook would be legally obligated to hand one over. It’s easy to believe something of this sort would never happen again. However, in this day and age, I find reality to be anything but believable.</p> </main></html>
