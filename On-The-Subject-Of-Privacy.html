People across the world have grown accustomed to handing over sensitive information as surveillance capitalism becomes standard and online ads gain more and more eyes.</p> <p id="header2"> The Pros of Information Collection</p> <p> Not many privacy advocates would consider the possibility that any good can come from all this information collection. While not good for user's privacy, there are definitely advantages to be had with targetted advertising and large revenue for tech firms.</p> <p> First and foremost, targetted advertising allows the advertising budget for any small company to drop significantly, making marketing to a target audience significantly cheaper and allowing smaller companies to compete. Never before has it been feasible that a small company could advertise to as much of its target audience as a much larger competitor without spending a massive amount on marketing. If no information was collected, it could be argued that Coca-Cola would be able to advertise to more soda lovers than a start-up could, since the only way to reach more of your target audience is to purchase more advertisements. </p> <p> Online advertising also allows for companies like Google and Facebook to generate significant amounts of revenue without charging their users a cent. The importance of this can not be overstated enough&mdash; setting the internet standard of both free access to information and free communication to everyone, everywhere, is a massive step forward and is unfortunately taken for granted by most people.</p> <p id="header2"> The Cons of Information Collection</p> <p> The number one concern for many people relates to privacy due to unwanted information collection, which happens whether you knowingly use a service or not. Google Analytics/Adsense and Facebook's "Like" buttons which appear on many webpages send information about how the actions of the user on said site. Furthermore, many techniques such as "Fingerprinting" have been developed to tie a visiting user back to their Facebook profile or Google account, essentially allowing these companies to college information about you on other websites and tie it back to your online identity, without you ever knowing. Google and Facebook both preach privacy and give users settings to control how their data is used and what is collected (mostly to avoid regulation), but they don't get the option to turn off collection from these companies on other websites. Additionally, all pro-privacy settings are turned off by default, and most users don't even know they are being watched in the first place and thus have no reason to find these settings and disable them.</p> <p> Not only is all the information collection a breach of priacy, but a waste of resources at the user's expense. Many news websites that are GDPR compliant use significantly less data and have much faster load times than their US counterparts. Overtime, this can potentially result in higher data bills, lower battery life, and time wasted.</p> <p> Governments can and do abuse the information collected by companies by requiring them to hand over all of a user's personal information if they request it, and prohibit these companies from notifying the users whose data has been stolen. Dozens of governments make hundreds, if not thousands of requests from major tech companies a year, violating a number of the rights their citizens believe they have.</p> <hr> <p id="header2"> "Are you free if you are being watched?"</p> <p> Many people act differently if they believe they are being watched. After Edward Snowden leaked the NSA's unconstitutional surveillance on it's citizens, there was a significant drop in searches that may have gotten people flagged as dangerous. </p> </main></html>
