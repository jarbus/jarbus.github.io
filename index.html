I like to write, so I made this website to give myself a place to share my writing however I please. I also like minimalist design, and wanted to challenge myself to design a beautiful website that requires as little resources as possible.</p> <p>Luckily, having such a minimal interface made it easy to have one file with the HTML for the heading, which I could then use to generate a static HTML file for each post. This site uses absolutely no JavaScript, PHP, or outsite resources which means incredibly fast load times.</p> </main></html>
