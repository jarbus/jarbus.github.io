For a significant number of people, this is indeed a good thing: a person with a minor interest in art can be guided to delve much deeper into the subject. The knowledge available online is virtually unlimited, and I'm very grateful for the resources these algorithms have exposed me to which help me learn about the world and topics that interest me. Unfortunately, not everyone, myself included, reacts positively when exposed to a lot of similar content, especially when that content is the subject for a controversial issue, where it is very important to be exposed to both sides. Bias in this type of media such typically presents one side as correct or morally superior, and a constant stream of this type of content can easily pave the way for a close-minded view of the world, or even worse, radicalization of the individual.<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>5</sup></span></p> <p id="header2" id="the-solution">The Solution?</p id="header2"> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've recently started to believe there's no one right answer to most prevelant questions today — usually if there are many different perspectives, each perspective tends to have a few merits.<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>6</sup></span> In fact, most of the time I find there are no right answers, just solutions that sacrifice one value in order to gain another.<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>7</sup></span> One such solution to this problem is to simply avoid anything controversial — no more left versus right, no more Mac vs PC, no more them vs us. It's a simple solution, and an effective one at that, but closes one off from a large part of our culture, so it doesn't exactly help the consumer become more open-minded, does it?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another solution, one I am trying to adopt, is to simply become more critical, especially when I agree with the material being presented. If I'm reading an article about why such and such technology is the future, or why x-ism is the right economic framework, I try to read it in the mindset of someone who questions everything they see. If a presenter is trying to convince their audience of something, the audience must make them fight tooth and nail to gain their trust and belief. Every statistic should be acknowledged as cherry picked for making a point<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>8</sup></span>, and the specific contexts of those statistics must be questioned. If one was to look hard enough, I'd argue 9 times out of 10 they could most likely find technically true information to support an opposing view.</p> <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's a world of difference between truth and facts. Facts can obscure the truth.&quot;— Maya Angelou</p> </blockquote> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading with this mindset requires that one connect to facts to form a logical structure, also known as a coherent argument, and analyze this structure to look for any missing pieces. Ask questions to push this to the limits and make sure the argument holds given anything I throw at it — as if one were to do quality assurance testing.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if presented with facts demonstrating how wealth inequality is larger than it's ever been, it's near instinct to feel outraged and not consider what this actually implies. It does not imply more people are poorer now than ever before, nor does it imply that quality of life is worse for anyone. These conclusions must be reached on their own, with their own arguments. It's essential to not let anyone jump to conclusions before I have the time to consider what they are saying.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd assume there are many other tactics and methods people can utilize to avoid the manipulation of online content, none of which currently come to mind.</p> <p id="header2" id="applications">Applications</p id="header2"> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be hypocritical to write this post without applying these concepts to said post. I'll go over the ideas I just presented, this time with a more skeptical approach. Each of the following criticisms corresponds to a number<span class="math inline"><em></em><sup>0</sup></span> in this post.</p> <ol style="list-style-type: decimal"> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opening claim makes a statement that not everyone will agree with with no reason as to why they should agree. It assumes the reader will understand the claim as a given and does not argue for it. Many sources strive to be as unbiased as possible and do in-depth research to paint as accurate of a picture as possible.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a personal opinion with no example given. Even if an example was given, fans of the product could simply have the bias that the review should be more positive when the product is really that mundane for the average person.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diverse team of people should not be considered the only way content can avoid bias. Motivated creators/artists/journalists are capable of trying to simply expose the audience to a subject instead of trying to paint a picture of a topic.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might algorithms be designed to do something else? A business wants to maximize profit, but theoretically profit maximization comes in the form of people paying for stuff that they use <em>just</em> enough that they won't stop subscribing/buying again. Note that this only applies to paid services, for free services that use advertisements, profit maximization requires maximum user engagement.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have denied the rabbit hole of online radicalization, claiming people are equally exposed to biased content are additionally exposed to unbiased content/opposite views and simply decide what they want themselves.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's totally possible for sides to be completely wrong, like in the cases of vaccines causing autism or holocaust deniers.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also totally possible for solutions to be completely perfect — in cases like technology, some things are simply better than others — a sword is simply better than a sharp rock, and taking an airplane from New York to California is simply better than walking.</p></li> <li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many areas of reserach, statistics may not be cherry picked to support an argument but instead the foundation for trying to develop a framework in line with them, such as string theory.</p></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just something to think about :)</p> <ul> <li>jazzz</li> </ul> </main></html>
