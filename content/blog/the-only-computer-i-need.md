I just [upgraded the processor](/blog/framework-13-upgrade-experience) in my Framework 13, and all things considered, it went well. Most importantly, it was *easy*. I also upgraded the webcam, which took about five minutes to swap.

The original machine with a Ryzen 7640U was `$`1k, and the HX 370 mainboard upgrade was `$`1k. You could probably get a "better" laptop for $2k, but it wouldn't be nearly as repairable or upgradable. You'd also only have a single computer. With a framework upgrade, you get two machines.

There's a lot of cool DIY projects people do with their old framework mainboards, but I didn't expect to find a use for mine. We ended up turning it into a personal server using the [$40 Coolermaster Case](https://frame.work/products/cooler-master-mainboard-case). Our previous server was a ten-year-old budget gaming machine that used a lot of power and had louder fans, so this was a welcome upgrade.

Framework machines have excellent Linux support, which means my "old" mainboard works wonderfully as a server. It's tiny, quiet, and draws little power, as you might expect from a 13-inch laptop motherboard. It can easily handle the 5 or 6 docker containers we're running.

Re-using old hardware also *feels nice*. I'm getting legitimate value out of repurposing something I already have, and I didn't buy a whole new laptop or throw out an old one (excluding the original webcam). 

Honestly, I can't see myself buying a new laptop as long as Framework keeps making mainboards that are compatible with the current 13-inch chasis.
