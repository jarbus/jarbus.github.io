My latest paper is available on arxiv: [Low Rank Factorizations are Indirect Encodings for Deep Neuroevolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03037). 

The general idea is that we can search for stronger neural networks in a gradient-free fashion by restricting search to networks of low-rank. We show that it works well for language modeling reinforcement learning tasks. It's essentially a crossover between the following papers:

* [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)
* [Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567).

I'll be presenting it virtually for the [Neuroevolution@Work](https://newk-gecco.github.io/) workshop at [GECCO 2025](https://gecco-2025.sigevo.org/HomePage).
