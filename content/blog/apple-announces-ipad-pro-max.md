**CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA** - Apple today announced the release of the groundbreaking iPad Pro Max, the world's first tablet powered by the all-new quantum Q1 processor. Capable of 30 octillion floating point operations per second, the Q1 makes the iPad Pro Max the most powerful streaming device ever made, over 2x faster than the M4 iPad Pro. Available in both 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, Apple says that the iPad Pro Max is the perfect device for generating TV shows, movies, and games in real-time on the go using the power of AI, no network connection needed. 

The new iPad Pro Max--the thinnest device Apple has ever created--features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 3 nanometers thin--thinner than a piece of paper--and the 13-inch model is just 2 nanometers, thanks to TSMC's cutting-edge 2-nanometer process, ensuring that you always have enough space in your bag for your Macbook to do real work. 

With the iPad Pro Max's stunning 16k display, today's children can play Roblox in stunning detail, giving them the edge they need to dominate their less-affluent friends. With 100,000 nits of peak brightness, the iPad Pro Max can even be seen on the surface of the sun, enabling our astronauts to make the music they dreamed of in Garageband while still maintaining 10 minutes of battery life.

The beautiful Magic Keyboard Pro Max is the perfect companion for the iPad Pro Max. Featuring a new function row, larger trackpad, and hydraulic press, we can crush the dreams of our users and regulators like never before. The gorgeous aluminum palm rest and trackpad with haptic feedback makes the entire experience feel just like using a macbook, without the software.

The vesatility of the iPad Pro Max is enhanced by the new Apple Pencil Pro Max, which can now be used to write on any surface, including the air, thanks to Apple's new AirInk technology, enabling anyone to change the world with a stroke. The Apple Pencil Pro Max starts at just $199,999.99, the Magic Keyboard Pro Max at $399,999.99, and the iPad Pro Max at just $999,999.99.

The iPad Pro Max is designed with the environment in mind. Featuring the thinnest, most irrepairable design in any product to date, the iPad Pro Max is guaranteed to take up less space in landfills than any other tablet on the market. Apple has also announced a new Core Technology Recycling Program, customers can return unsupported devices to Apple, in exchange for Apple charging a $0.50 Core Technology Recycling fee to the developer of each non-Apple app remaining on the device.
