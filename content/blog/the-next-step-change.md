Many people are wondering what the next step change in AI looks like.

Some people think we need more data, more compute.

Some people think we need some neuro-symbolic approach.

We got this far because we've been optimizing a single objective that boils down to a ton of micro-objectives.

The task of predicting the next word includes as subtasks learning syntax, parts of speech, logical reasoning, memorization, and more.

To me, the obvious next step change has the following properties:
  - is not bounded by data
  - scales with compute
  - can achieve super-human performance on a wide variety of tasks
  - consists of a function to optimize which is composed of millions of sub-functions
