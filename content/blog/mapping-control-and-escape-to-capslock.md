title: "Mapping Control and Escape to Capslock"

I try to use default keybindings and keyboard layouts as much as possible, but as a vim user, I've always mapped Caps Lock to escape wherever possible. On certain mechanical keyboards (I use the [Drop ALT](https://drop.com/buy/drop-alt-mechanical-keyboard)) you can map multiple functions to the same key, so a tap presses one key while holding it treats it as another. I never thought about this much until recently, but realized this functionality is *incredible* for vim **and** tmux users:

> Map `Caps Lock` to `Escape` when tapped and `Control` when held. You can use vim splits with `C-w` and tmux panes with `C-b` without needing to reach for `Control`. 

Game changer for comfort.
