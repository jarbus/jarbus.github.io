I loved to make things. However, over time, my desire to create was stomped out. It never felt encouraged in the environment I grew up in, and the people that tried to create were mocked and called &quot;cringey&quot; until they stopped showing off what they made. I want to get back into making something, and this is that something.</p></li> <li><p>I want to share things I find interesting.</p></li> <li><p>I want my own space on the internet to freely express my thoughts.</p></li> <li><p>I want to broaden my own view of the world, and potentially help other people broaden theirs. Life is too incredible to spend most of it wadding in the one-sided negativity a lot of algorithms end of funneling people into.</p></li> <li><p>I want to improve my writing.</p></li> </ol> <p id="header2" id="who-are-you-writing-for">Who are you writing for?</p id="header2"> <p>I'm mostly writing for people like myself, who feel that there is so much to be pondered and so little that can be truly known. I used to be a very close-minded person who thought they had most things figured out, until I realized just how little I truly knew.</p> <p id="header2" id="what-inspired-you-to-write">What inspired you to write?</p id="header2"> <p>Scott Alexander - Psychiatrist and Writer of the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a>. The top posts section really has some content that makes you think. He''ll make a point that seems right and is backed by evidence, then flip it on it's head and refute it, even if he believes the original point. Very good person to inspire critical thinking. David Perell - Online <a href="https://www.perell.com/">writer</a> and host of the <a href="http://www.perell.com/podcast/">North Star Podcast</a>. Doesn't make you think as much, but gives you stuff to think about.</p> <p id="header2" id="who-are-you">Who are you?</p id="header2"> <p>I strongly believe in the idea of anonymity when it comes to expressing an idea, and not the person behind it. There are no ways to just what I have to say aside from what and how I say it-- I could turn out to be a teenage white girl or an 80-year-old black grandfather, and no one could discredit me for it.</p> </main></html> </main></html>
