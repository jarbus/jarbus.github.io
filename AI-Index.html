It’s introduced me to a lot of terminology used both on the show and off that I wasn’t too familiar with. As a result, I’ve made an ever-expanding list of concepts in the field of AI to give myself and others an easy reference.</p> <p>Each item in the list contains a short, rudimentary definition I’ve written, as well as a link to a resource that can explain it better.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitive-understanding-of-attention-mechanism-in-deep-learning-6c9482aecf4f">Attention</a>: Neural networks are able to “pay attention” to specific parts of input or output, useful in translating languages or predicting sequences. For example, when trying to predict the next word in “the clouds in the”, you pay attention to the word <em>cloud</em> to predict the word <em>sky</em></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder">Autoencoder</a><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup><em>W</em></sup></span>: A type of neural network that attempts to take raw data, convert it into a simpler representation (usually by limiting the amount of nodes in a hidden layer for representation), and then decode the representation back into it’s data.

A simple example is <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a>, that can generate fake pictures of humans.</p> <ul> <li>GANs consist of one generator network with the goal to make realistic new data, and a distinction network with the goal to tell real data from fake. As the networks train, they each improve at their individual task, forcing their adversaries to improve in turn.</li> </ul></li> <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic Algorithms</a><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup><em>W</em></sup></span>: Algorithms that try to mimic the evolutionary process by randomly modifying the best-performing sets of parameters while discarding those with the worst performance, then repeating.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>: A language model from OpenAI that can generate text that mimics a writing style incredibly well.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">Gradient Descent</a><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup><em>W</em></sup></span>: An interative process that attempts to find a minimum of a function that works by moving in the direction that will decrease the gradient until a local minima is reached.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car">Level 0-5</a><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup><em>W</em></sup></span>: The different “levels” of autonomy related to self driving cars. 0 represents full human control while 5 represents full vehicle control.</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)</a><span class="math inline"><em></em><sup><em>W</em></sup></span>: A type of recurrent neural network that works exceptionally well with sequential input.
